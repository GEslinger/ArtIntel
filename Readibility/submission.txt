To get my code, run this command in a directory!
git clone git@github.com:GEslinger/ArtIntel.git

Go into the Readibility directory and run
make all

Then, run the program with
./Analyze
The output will be ASL, ASW, and the Flesch-Kincaid readibility score.

I'm working with a mostly functional syllable recognizer I wrote from scratch. Here are the steps it takes to count syllables:
Tally up all the vowels and y that occur in the word, to use as a rough estimate of the number of syllables.
If there's an e towards the end of the word, it might as well be silent so remove that.
If there's a string of two or more vowels, use a greedy removal function to reduce it to one vowel (ex. ea -> e, ueue -> u)
Output the number!!

Other than that, it does all the regular stuff.
Change the INFILE constant at the start to make it look at another file.
Also, please don't give it files like the examples on canvas without cleaning them up, as they're full of weird characters and crazy newline sequences.

Here's what I got for my files.
