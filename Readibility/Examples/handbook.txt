INTRODUCTION The South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics was established by an Act of the South Carolina General Assembly signed by Governor Carroll Campbell in 1987. The first class of some sixty-five high school juniors came to the school in the fall of 1988, and a similar group followed in 1989. The Act created a governing Board of Trustees, which is responsible for developing policy and for overall governance of the School. This Student Handbook is the official manual for GSSM students. All students should read the policies, statements, rules, and regulations contained in this handbook carefully. A. Mission Statement The purpose of the South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics (GSSM) is to offer the most academically able students of this state a learning environment that strengthens their ability to think critically, stimulates the joy of learning, and fosters the excitement of discovery through scientific research. GSSM broadens the horizons of the mind, expands intellectual and personal growth, and cultivates the uniqueness of each student. GSSM builds a strong sense of community among students, faculty, and staff in a residential setting. GSSM is an educational resource, which serves the State of South Carolina as a model for academic excellence and provides a diverse range of outreach programs and partnerships. B. Student Development Mission The Student Development Division establishes and maintains a community living environment that is secure, comfortable, enjoyable, and accepting of diversity; where students learn to live and live to learn, with emphasis on ethical decision-making. By offering opportunities for personal development and leadership through student organizations, athletics, and residence life programming, the Student Development Division supports the Institution’s academic goals and nurtures the spirit and principles of community living. C. Curriculum and the Educational Experience Combining rigorous class work, directed laboratory investigation, and independent research, GSSM fosters in its students the ability to create and develop ideas. In a supportive and disciplined learning environment, students are challenged to think critically and independently. The school cultivates the uniqueness of each student while encouraging the development of a community of scholars. Students learn from and teach each other in an intellectual atmosphere, which encourages the synthesis of newlyacquired knowledge and individual experience. While emphasizing intellectual growth and maturity in science and mathematics, the curriculum also encourages thoughtful development in the Humanities. Students complete an independent mentored science research project which focuses on laboratory research or field work at university and industrial laboratories throughout the state. They also have access to advanced laboratories for biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science. Independent study courses under faculty guidance are also available and economics and finance are highlighted through GSSM’s latest academic initiative. Academic excellence, enthusiasm, and dedication characterize the unique faculty (about 3/4 of whom hold doctorates in their field) of GSSM. Experienced in high school and college teaching, faculty and staff members recognize the value of creative, stimulating classroom experience supplemented by individual contact and support. Students discover to their amazement that science and humanities teachers echo each other in their demand for clear, logical thinking and in their emphasis on integrity and ethical  2 concerns in academic pursuits. Faculty and staff continue to develop professionally as recipients of grants for summer study and research and as participants in professional conferences. Administrative staff working directly with students also reflects this concern for the whole student. In order to help them realize their potential, students receive professional guidance that prepares them to take advantage of enhanced opportunities for higher education through assistance with college admissions and by identification of potential financial aid sources. Career exploration is also a focus. D. Philosophy and Expectations A residential school is a community. Contributions made by those who reside and work in such a setting will ultimately benefit everyone through the creation of a climate that promotes purposeful learning and living. GSSM was created to provide such an opportunity. This community of scholars allows all to contribute to and learn from others the joy of discovery and the stretching of one's limits. Each member of the GSSM community is expected to respect the rights and support the responsibilities of every other person here. The living and learning environment of GSSM is based upon the following principles and expectations: 1. Privilege and Right: Attending GSSM is always a privilege and never a right. This privilege must continue to be earned while in attendance. The two primary criteria for continuing at GSSM are academic performance and personal citizenship in the GSSM community. 2. Responsibility: While students have the freedom to make a number of important individual choices, they must understand that with this freedom goes responsibility. At the most basic level, students are responsible for learning, and teachers are responsible for teaching. Students are expected to prepare for, attend, and participate in all of their classes and labs. Students will be held accountable for the decisions they make and for their behavior in and out of the classroom, as well as off campus. 3. Motivation and Commitment: We expect each member of the community to strive for excellence in his/her academic, social, and personal development. Students are expected to exercise self-discipline and to meet their commitments, both in and out of the classroom. 4. Fair Play and Civility: Everyone at GSSM deserves to be treated with respect and courtesy. Concern for one's fellow students and mutual enforcement of standards of conduct are essential in the GSSM community. 5. Safety and Security: We expect students to take appropriate responsibility to care for themselves, their campus, their environment, and each other. 6. Health and Hygiene: We advocate good physical and mental health for all members of our community. Students are expected to exhibit care for personal hygiene and community cleanliness. 7. Honor and Truth: We expect students to be honest with themselves, with each other, and with faculty and staff members. 8. Personal Accountability: It is an expectation that members of the GSSM student body will exercise a high degree of personal responsibility and accept accountability for their choices. In their studies and in their conduct, students are expected to understand the correct course of action and to follow it without relying on excuses for falling short. They should understand and practice ethical decision-making and seek guidance before acting when the best course is unclear. 3 Students at this level are expected to meet all imposed deadlines without prompting. This responsibility is required just as much outside the classroom as it is inside. It pertains to all academic assignments, scheduled meetings and appointments, college and scholarship deadlines (internal and external), as well as areas of daily life. Failure to meet deadlines in any area of individual responsibility will always result in consequences that can vary from making a negative impression, a missed opportunity, a disciplinary sanction, or more formal penalties. 9. Official Announcements and GSSM Email: We expect every member of the GSSM community to read each day’s Official Announcements and check their school email account daily. E. Importance of Community At the South Carolina Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics, we recognize the importance of building a community within our school to promote the success of the school and its members. Because of its residential environment, the community embodies values similar to those of a family. Such a community fosters consideration, compassion, collective responsibility, support, and personal accountability. Communication within the community, leading to transparency in the functioning of the school, allows for a sense of trust and mutual understanding among the students, faculty, staff, and administration that we strive to achieve. These goals cannot be compromised, as above all the success of the student in academics, the quality of education, and cooperation between the educator and the students command priorities of all associated with the school. With the help of all members, regardless of race, color, ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, geographic location, religion, and/or other distinguishing expressions, we show respect for each other as we show respect for ourselves. As we consider diversity at GSSM, integrity should guide us in our deportment and interactions. Mutual respect requires that we acknowledge the reasonable requests of others and that we understand that our rights should not impose on those of other community members. GSSM welcomes diversity and is inclusive within the context of a residential high school with underage students. F. Honor Code and Honor Statement Each member of the Governor's School community is responsible for acting with honor and integrity in every facet of academic and residential life. Every member benefits from the self-respect and pride of living in an environment of honorable people whose focus is on learning. Individuals within the community have the obligation to invoke personal responsibility and insist upon a similar manner of conduct from others. Certain actions are considered a breach of this mutual trust inherent within the system. Students are expected to adhere to the GSSM Honor Code at all times. Faculty, per their discretion, will also require the Honor Statement to be included on assignments. 1. Honor Code I will not commit any act of lying, cheating, stealing, academic dishonesty, vandalism, illegal Intervisitation, or action in violation of South Carolina or federal law (such as possession or use of alcohol or other drugs). If I witness a violation of the honor code, I am encouraged to report the violation to a member of the administration, faculty, or staff and express either: a. Willingness to go before the administration, Judicial Council, or Honor Council as a witness, or b. A desire for confidentiality. 2. Honor Statement* On my honor, I have neither given nor received help on this test/assignment.  4 *The honor statement may be modified by individual instructors for particular assignments. Instructors will inform students when the statement is to be written and signed on assignments. Each faculty member should include on the syllabus or other class document the standards of working together for his/her class so students know when they are and are not permitted to work together. Penalties for Honor Code violations are serious and are treated in accordance with other disciplinary issues at GSSM. Please refer to the Discipline/Honor Code Section of this Handbook for details. 5 II. STUDENT RECORDS, RESIDENCY, AND FEES A. Notification of Rights Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords parents and students over 18 years of age (“eligible students”) certain rights with respect to students’ educational records. These rights are outlined below: 1. Parents and eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of a written request made to the President of GSSM. The request must identify the specific record(s) they wish to inspect. The President will make arrangements for access and notify the parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. 2. Parents or an eligible student have the right to request the amendment of the student’s education record that is believed to be inaccurate or misleading. They should write the President of GSSM, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. Should the President of GSSM decide not to amend the student’s record, the parents or eligible student will be notified of their right to a hearing regarding the request for an amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. Upon request, GSSM will disclose education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. Except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent, the parent or an eligible student has the right to have personally identifiable information not disclosed. a. If requested, GSSM will disclose without parental or eligible student consent, Directory Information (student’s name and home address, photograph, weight and height of athletes, previous schools attended, date and place of birth, dates of attendance, and awards and activities) to appropriate sources unless the parent or eligible student withdraws consent to disclose Directory Information within 30 days of the issuance of this notice. Withdrawal of consent must be written. b. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by a District or school as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel); a person serving on the Board of GSSM, a person or company with whom the District or school has contracted to perform a special task (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist); or a parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. Unless consent has been withdrawn, directory information will be shared with the GSSM Foundation. c. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educational record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. 6 d. A parent or eligible student has the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by GSSM to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Such complaints should be forwarded to: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, DC 20202-4605 B. Policy for Maintenance, Retention and Disclosure of Student Records The institution’s President is the legal custodian of all student records for the Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics. School records for each student shall include, at a minimum, the Student Permanent Record file and the Student Discipline Record. Information in the Student Permanent Record file shall include the student’s name, permanent address, date of birth, Social Security number, name(s) of parent(s), academic records of GSSM and sending high school (showing courses taken, grades, standardized test information, type of diploma issued, graduation or separation date). This file may also include other types of educational records or material such as photographs, health and immunization records, birth certificate (copy), admission application, general correspondence to/from parents/guardians and school personnel, and legal documents. Information in the Student Discipline Record file shall be cumulative and will be maintained separately from the Student Permanent Record file while the student is enrolled at GSSM. Upon receipt of a request for records from a secondary or post-secondary institution or entity, the Student Permanent Record shall be sent. Information from a Student Discipline Record shall be sent only upon receipt of a specific request from a secondary or post-secondary institution to which the student has applied. The educational records of students shall be maintained pursuant to state and federal law, specifically, the Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act (FERPA). The retention of students’ records shall be in accordance with the requirements set forth in Title 30, Public Records, S.C. Code Ann. sect. 30-1-10 et seq. (1991 & Supp.) and S.C. Code of Regulations sect. 12-906.1 et seq. (1996 & Supp.) and federal law, where applicable. In accordance with State Law, records pertaining to expulsions from GSSM shall be retained for 75 years following separation from GSSM. Records pertaining to suspensions are retained for one year after the date of separation from GSSM. All other records in the Student Discipline Record file are destroyed upon graduation. C. State and United States Residency Requirement It is the policy of GSSM to consider only students whose parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have established permanent legal residency in South Carolina by January 1 of the school year in which the student applies for admission. Applicants must meet all other admission criteria of the school. The parent/guardian of a student must still be a legal resident of South Carolina and the United States on the date the student enters school for their junior and senior year. A copy of a current state issued driver’s license or identification card and/or utility bill must be provided as proof of residency. The parent/guardian must notify the school immediately of any change in residency. Legal residency is established when one's principle domicile is maintained in the state. One is considered a legal resident by establishing physical presence in a location determined as his/her permanent home for a period of indefinite duration. 7 D. Fees and Deposits GSSM’s Board of Trustees and the school's administration are committed to the policy that “No student will be denied entrance to GSSM because of an inability to pay the Student Fee.” Financial assistance is available to those who qualify. In order to maintain its high quality programs, GSSM students pay an annual Student Fee which goes directly to help offset meal expenses for each student. This fee, combined with a subsidy from the school to make up the difference in providing meals, is reviewed and set annually by GSSM’s Board of Trustees. The exact amount of the annual Student Fee, along with time payment and Financial Aid options, based on family income, will be made available before the start of each school year. Financial Aid is based on the Federal Government’s Free and Reduced Lunch family income scale. Please remember: No student will be denied participation in the GSSM residential program for inability to pay fees. Other GSSM fees may be assessed for particular activities or special services. E. Room Security Deposit GSSM requires a $100 room security deposit. Any damages incurred during the year(s) will be itemized and billed. The deposit, less any unpaid expenses for damages, etc., will be refunded to the parent of a student not returning to GSSM in the fall semester. Damages to student rooms and suites will be charged to the occupants of the room or suite. All damages done on the hallways and to lounges will be charged to the residents of that hall. Damages to stairwells will be charged to the residents of the respective sides. All common areas downstairs (including, but not limited to, the lobby, dining hall, and classrooms) will be assessed to the entire student body. A 24-hour time period for investigation and for the individual(s) responsible for the damages to come forward will be allowed before charges are assessed. If no one accepts responsibility for the damages, appropriate assessments will be charged. Most damage billing will be deducted from the $100 security deposit each student paid upon enrolling at GSSM. However, some charges may be collected immediately as a form of restitution for intentional damages or those beyond normal “wear and tear.” Students will be notified when damage charges are assessed. Parents will receive a statement of room deposit deductions at the end of each year from the Business Office. F. Withdrawing from GSSM Occasionally, a student may wish to withdraw from GSSM. The decision to withdraw concludes all activities sanctioned by GSSM, including SPRI Research and January interim courses. Since such a decision is an irrevocable one, it should be thoroughly reviewed. Anyone wishing to withdraw must: 1. Review the matter with the Vice President for Student Development. 2. Return all library books, textbooks, pay any outstanding fees, and return his or her room key and identification card to the Residence Life Coordinator who is on duty. 3. Complete the withdrawal form available from the Vice President for Academic Affairs or Vice President for Student Development before leaving the campus. 4. Appeal to the President for an exception if the student wishes to complete SPRI after withdrawal from GSSM.  8 III. ACADEMICS A.

Academic Concentrations GSSM offers students the opportunity to concentrate study in one of several disciplines. In this manner, students may pursue academic areas of particular interest to them. They may bring their pursuit of academics above and beyond Advanced Placement to the attention of colleges and other interested parties. Students are cautioned that in most cases, they will have to have completed some advanced coursework prior to entry to GSSM for a concentration to be feasible. Concentrations are recognized by a special inscription on the GSSM diploma. A student should never pursue a Concentration as a mark of academic excellence; breadth in academic pursuits is fully as desirable as depth, especially for students just beginning their academic careers. 1. Biology An incoming student with no Advanced Placement score will need to earn a grade of B or above in Biology 201 and 202 plus at least two other biology courses at the 300 level. An incoming student with an Advanced Placement score of 5 who skips Biology 201 and 202 will need to earn a grade of B or above in at least three courses at the 300 level. 2. Physics For a GSSM diploma with a physics concentration, a student must take Physics 101-102 or Physics 201-202 in the junior year and at least one of the following each subsequent semester: Physics 203, Physics 204, Physics 210, and Physics 301. A 5 on the Physics C AP test will be accepted in lieu of 201 or 202 as appropriate. 3. Chemistry The student will complete the following chemistry courses while at GSSM: the advanced Chemistry sequence (Chemistry 201 and 202) and at least one of the following: Chemistry 302 (Organic), Chemistry 304 (Analytical Chemistry), or Chemistry 305 (Biochemistry). 4. Mathematics and Computer Science To earn the concentration in Mathematics and Computer Science, a student must make a B or above in the following selection of courses: two of the following mathematics courses (Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Discrete Structures, or Multivariable Calculus) and at least one course in computer science beyond 101 AP Computer Science. 5. Economics and Finance To earn a concentration in Economics and Finance, a student must earn a B or above in at least three the following courses: Technology Ventures, Financial Analysis, AP Microeconomics, and AP Macroeconomics. 6. Humanities The student will complete four term electives, distributed among or concentrated in the English, Foreign Languages, or History Department. Electives may be chosen only after required courses in the department have been completed. 11 C. Courses and Schedules 1. Course Descriptions A listing of course descriptions is published separately in the GSSM Course Catalog. 2. Course Load The minimum course load is six classes for seniors and six classes for juniors each semester. Juniors are also required to take and pass one-hour per week seminars in the areas of Life and Leisure (Fall and Spring), Entrepreneurial Leadership (Fall), and College Guidance (Spring) during their junior year. The maximum number of laboratory courses each semester is three. Students are discouraged from taking eight courses. Students who request an eighth course must have a 4.25 GPA for all prior GSSM work and must have the approval of their parents, advisor, instructor in the course, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs. 3. Add/Drop The last day for adding a course is seven school days after classes have begun. The last day to drop a course without it appearing on the transcript is four weeks. Courses may be dropped until midterm with a notation of withdrew passing (WP) or withdrew failing (WF) on the transcript. 4. Course Placement Every effort is made to place juniors in courses that are at the correct level based on their previous academic experience. Occasionally, a student may be misplaced. In such cases, the Vice President for Academic Affairs, in consultation with the subject teacher and faculty advisor, may shift a student to a different level course. The deadlines and recording rules noted above are waived in these unusual circumstances. 5. Auditing Students will be allowed to audit a class, with prior approval of the instructor and consent of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, without receiving a grade or credit, provided there is space available. Specific requirements about completion of homework, projects, tests, etc., are at the discretion of the instructor. 6. Coker College Courses Students may register for Coker College courses at their own expense. The Vice President for Academic Affairs must grant prior approval. Enrollment will be permitted only for electives not needed for graduation requirements. Such opportunities are very limited due to scheduling difficulties. 7. Articulation Agreements GSSM will be reauthorizing the agreements with Clemson University, College of Charleston, and the University of South Carolina-Columbia during the 2015-2016 school year. We anticipate for students to continue to receive college credit for GSSM courses that are closely aligned with the university’s courses. Please consult the GSSM Course Catalog for detailed tables regarding which courses match each university. Some courses in the agreement are in the Advance Placement (AP) program while others are beyond this level. Students should continue to take the AP exams where applicable. 8. Language Labs Only team members in good academic standing (with general permission from the instructors) and one manager per team are allowed to miss language labs for athletic events. Students must complete an absentee form each time. 12 9. Transfer Credit GSSM gives credit for all courses on the home school transcript. After entering GSSM, students may neither take summer or online courses in lieu of GSSM requirements or for credit on the GSSM transcript. College courses will be noted on the transcript with no credit granted. 10. Grade Reporting Grades are given to students and sent home to parents after the mid-term of each semester and after semester exams. Instructors are encouraged to provide rapid and frequent feedback, especially for juniors, throughout the year. At any time, students can ask their instructors about their grades; however, we encourage students to take responsibility for knowing what their grades are in courses by recording them and referring to the syllabi for their courses. 11. Semester Exams Exams are given in all courses in December and May. A few courses do not lend themselves to final exams and a project may be assigned in lieu of an exam. For seniors with A’s in a course, a teacher may elect to exempt them from the May exam only. 12. Meetings with Instructors If an instructor requests that a student meet with him or her, the student is expected to attend the meeting. A missed meeting will result in a Level 1 Offense (2m. Missing an appointment or required meeting). 13. Course Instructors and Course Times  Students do not have the ability to select instructors or course times. It is important to learn  how to learn in all situations and from all different teaching styles. Learning from our diverse  and talented instructors will prepare you for learning in the college setting and beyond. In  order to provide the best educational experience, we try to balance classes as best possible  (i.e. similar number of students in each class). Since a number of our courses are taught in  one semester and since we allow students to add and drop courses at the beginning of  semesters, there is sometimes a need to rebalance classes for instructors at the beginning  of each semester and sometimes after a few weeks into a semester. D. Textbooks GSSM provides textbooks for all students. It is the responsibility of the student to return the books in good condition at the end of the course. Damaged or lost books will be charged to the student. No grades or transcripts will be available to a student until all outstanding financial obligations are met. Books borrowed from the Coker College Library are similarly the responsibility of the student.  E. Academic Advisors Academic advisors work with their advisees, teachers, the Vice President for Academic Affairs, and the Vice President for Student Development to help solve specific academic problems that arise during the school year. It is essential that the advisor communicate with the teachers of their advisees and with the administration. Teachers can usually provide much more information and insight concerning the student’s performance than is given in a formal grade; in return, the advisor can often help other teachers understand their apparent success or lack of success in individual cases by sharing appropriate, nonconfidential information. The advisor should also contact coaches, residence life staff, and extracurricular advisors to get a broader insight into the advisee’s attitude, behavior, and degree of success or failure and extent of cooperation. 13 F. Independent Study Independent Study at the South Carolina Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics is designed to provide additional opportunities for highly motivated students to pursue areas of their special interest. Independent Study courses are student-initiated and allow students to explore areas of interest beyond what is offered in the catalog. It is aimed at enhancing the quality of our program by adding to it a customized course in an area of interest of a student and expertise of the instructor beyond what is already offered. Independent Study Course proposals will only be considered for 0.5 Carnegie unit (equivalent time commitment required as a regular semester-long course). In some rare cases, Independent Study Courses could be considered for 1.0 Carnegie unit. Independent Study courses must be approved by the Curriculum Committee. Students wishing to enroll in an Independent Study course must meet at least one of these criteria: ? A student wishes to extend knowledge in a discipline where all relevant existing courses have been completed with a grade of 90 or above or at the permission of instructor and approval of the Curriculum Committee. The Curriculum Committee reserves the right to determine if all relevant courses have been taken in an area of study in order to warrant an Independent Study course. In some cases it will be advised that a student take an existing course instead of an Independent Study course. ? A student needs to complete a requirement for graduation (normally only in the Spring semester of the Senior year) when there is no course available in the specific subject that the student may schedule or an unavoidable scheduling conflict exists, provided that the Independent Study is not being used to replace a failed regular class. In special circumstances the instructor and student may request an exemption from the Curriculum Committee. Please note: ? Faculty members are under no obligation to teach an Independent Study. ? No faculty member may teach more than two independent study courses per academic semester. ? Independent Study courses are student-initiated and are considered to be a contract between the student and professor to complete a course of study. Procedure to follow for approval of an Independent Study: 1. To receive approval for an Independent Study, the Independent Study instructor and student will provide the Curriculum Committee with an Independent Study Proposal Form, which includes the course description, course syllabus and a student’s individual academic information. 2. The Curriculum Committee will evaluate the request along with the other course requests for that semester and will give pre-approval, deny the request or seek additional information in order to make a decision. 3. Final approval of an Independent Study is contingent on final student grades for the semester prior to when the Independent Study will occur and the final schedule for the instructor and student for that semester. G. Attendance, Absences, and Makeup Policy 1. It is the responsibility of the student who is absent from class or other mandatory activities to ensure that all obligations are fulfilled. Within seven calendar days of the absence, all work should be made up. When the instructor deems it appropriate, an extension of the seven-day deadline may be granted. If a student has not contacted an instructor within two class meetings, that student will forfeit the privilege of completing any assignments for that class and will receive a grade of D for those assignments. 14 2. Students are required to attend all of their classes and labs at GSSM unless they have excused absences. To receive the full benefit of the academic experience at GSSM, participation with their classmates and teachers in all classes and labs is essential. For those occasions when absences are necessary, the policy for excused absences is described below. 3. Students must see the School Nurse, a Residence Life Coordinator, or the Director of Campus Life prior to missing a class for illness or the absence will be recorded as unexcused. The procedure for reporting illness is as follows: a. If a student is ill, he/she must go to the School Nurse. If the nurse is not in the office, the student is to call the Residence Life Coordinator on duty. b. If a student is in class and becomes ill, the student should ask permission from the instructor to leave class to see the nurse but then must follow the procedures listed above. c. When the student sees the nurse, the nurse may determine the student needs to see a doctor and will make the appropriate recommendation to the student. If a visit to the doctor is recommended, the nurse, in consultation with the student’s parent, will schedule the appointment. 4. There are three categories of excused absences: a. Category I: This category includes absences for illness, doctor appointments, events sponsored by GSSM, scholarship interviews, funerals, and other situations which GSSM staff determine to be of a similar nature. Although there is no official limit to the number of days for this type of absence, please make plans that avoid missing classes when possible. b. Category II: Students may take up to five academic days for college visits during the two years at GSSM. Please use long weekends, holidays, and summer breaks to minimize the loss of academic days. c. Category III: Up to three days each year may be taken for family and personal matters. This category includes various family activities, traffic court, and similar reasons. Save these days for unanticipated events when possible. 5. Completed requests for planned excused absences must be submitted to the Office of the Vice President for Student Development at least three full class days prior to a planned absence. A completed request consists of an excused absence form with teacher signatures and a letter from the parent, which includes reason, dates/times, and vehicle/driver/travel details. This advance notice is needed for efficient operation of the school office. GSSM staff may waive the advance notice requirement when they determine circumstances warrant. Otherwise, the request will be disapproved and/or a Level I for failure to follow instructions will be given. 6. Excused absences are not granted for the purpose of early departures or extensions of holiday periods. Please plan vacations and visits to prospective colleges accordingly. 7. Unexcused absences should be rare at GSSM. 8. All students should accept personal responsibility for attendance and understand its importance to their education. Teachers will assign academic penalties based on the missed opportunity for learning in the particular course or lab. The penalties will be imposed separately for each course or lab and will not exceed the following guidelines: a. Missed quizzes, tests, or late work: A reduction of up to 3 points on the Uniform Grading Scale (UGS) for the semester grade. Daily work will be made up at the discretion of the teacher. Make-up of major tests and labs is mandatory. 15 b. First absence: The teacher may warn and counsel the student about missing class. c. Second and each subsequent occurrence: Reduction of up to 3 points on the UGS for the semester may be imposed by the teacher. d. The combination of penalties stated above for missing a class and for graded work during the same class may not exceed 4 points on the UGS. e. Successful completion of the three Junior Seminars is a graduation requirement. Attendance policies and consequences are outlined in the syllabus for each seminar. Students are responsible for adhering to these policies. 9. Absences in excess of the limit in a category will be recorded as unexcused. There will be a few academic days when Category II and III absences are not permitted (for example Research Colloquium and SCJAS annual meeting) due to the importance and uniqueness of these days. Such days will be announced well in advance to parents and students. a. No credit will be given for a course if a student is absent from a class or lab more than 10 of the scheduled meetings (total of excused and unexcused absences). For extraordinary circumstances, waiver requests may be made by the parents to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. b. Students are expected to be on time for all scheduled classes. Tardies in a course that add up to 20 minutes during the semester may be counted as an unexcused absence. c. A deficiency form will be mailed to parents if a student has three unexcused absences in a course or two unexcused absences in a science lab during a semester. The necessity to schedule language labs in the evening creates a unique set of circumstances. Therefore, the policy for language labs is determined by the foreign language teachers and posted separately. The policy will be in the spirit of the overall GSSM policy for absences. H. Instructor Absence In case of the unplanned absence of an instructor, a note dated and signed by a faculty or staff member will be posted on the classroom door and/or on the First Class e-news. If there is no note and an instructor has not arrived for class within 5 minutes of the start time, one student should verify that the instructor is not in his/her office and then inform the Vice President for Academic Affairs or another member of the staff. All students will remain in the classroom until a staff member has given them further instructions or dismissed them. I. Grades/Academic Credit 1. By South Carolina law, all high schools, including GSSM, must use the Uniform Grading Scale (UGS). All courses are weighted as Advanced Placement or Honors. (See chart of UGS at the end of this section.) 2. There is no failing grade at GSSM; however, a grade of D does not receive academic credit and is considered unsatisfactory. A grade of D will transfer to the home school as a passing grade with credit. 3. For any course that must be retaken due to a grade of D, the student’s record will record that the course was taken twice and the grade earned each time. Only the higher grade will be used in GPA calculations. 4. Grades of incomplete (INC) will only be recorded in cases of illness or extreme family emergencies. The Academic Review Committee must approve a grade of INC and set a deadline for course work to be completed. Failure to meet this deadline will result in the INC being converted to a 70. 16 5. Progress grades are reported to parents and guardians once during each semester as well as at the end of each semester. South Carolina Uniform Grading Scale Conversions Numerical Average Letter Grade College Prep Honors AP/IB/ Dual Credit Numerical Average Letter Grade College Prep Honors AP/IB/ Dual Credit 100 A 4.875 5.375 5.875 84 C 2.875 3.375 3.875 99 A 4.750 5.250 5.750 83 C 2.750 3.250 3.750 98 A 4.625 5.125 5.625 82 C 2.625 3.125 3.625 97 A 4.500 5.000 5.500 81 C 2.500 3.000 3.500 96 A 4.375 4.875 5.375 80 C 2.375 2.875 3.375 95 A 4.250 4.750 5.250 79 C 2.250 2.750 3.250 94 A 4.125 4.625 5.125 78 C 2.125 2.625 3.125 93 A 4.000 4.500 5.000 77 C 2.000 2.500 3.000 92 B 3.875 4.375 4.875 76 D * 1.875 2.375 2.875 91 B 3.750 4.250 4.750 75 D * 1.750 2.250 2.750 90 B 3.625 4.125 4.625 74 D * 1.625 2.125 2.625 89 B 3.500 4.000 4.500 73 D * 1.500 2.000 2.500 88 B 3.375 3.875 4.375 72 D * 1.375 1.875 2.375 87 B 3.250 3.750 4.250 71 D * 1.250 1.750 2.250 86 B 3.125 3.625 4.125 70 D * 1.125 1.625 2.125 85 B 3.000 3.500 4.000 * No GPA/credit would be earned at GSSM, but GPA/credit would transfer to home high school. J. Academic Eligibility At the end of each grading period, the Academic Review Committee (ARC) will review the report card of any student who has one or more D’s and/or three or more C’s to determine if the student should be allowed to remain at GSSM. The ARC consists of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Student Development, and the Chairs of the Academic Divisions. The ARC will recommend to the President of GSSM whether the student should be separated from GSSM for unsatisfactory academic performance. The President, after consultation with the student and parents, will make the final determination. From time to time, the ARC may require a returning senior to accept academic probation as a condition for return. These students will have Pre-QUEST mandatory study hall or some other form of concentrated study (see section on Pre-QUEST) at the start of Fall semester. K. Class Rank The South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics does not rank its students. Because the student body represents a cross section of the brightest and highest-ranked students from the state, ranking is neither fair nor appropriate. 17 L. Class Testing and Assignments 1. Tests requiring the entire class period should be announced and placed on the school calendar at least one week in advance. No student is required to take more than three fullperiod tests on any day. Major paper due dates should also be placed on the school calendar. Short (less than 20 minutes) quizzes may be given without prior notification on the calendar. 2. Faculty members should assign a minimum amount of homework over a long weekend or after a major school event (all-day trip, convocation, prom, etc.). If at all possible, these assignments should be made well in advance of the weekend or event. No assignments should be made over vacation breaks, such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, winter, or spring break. 3. No quizzes or tests should be given on the first class day after a long weekend or vacation break. M. Plagiarism and Cheating A student must always reference the use of non-original material. Failure to acknowledge that one has borrowed ideas or words from an external source, including the Internet, is dishonest and impairs an instructor's ability to accurately evaluate a student's ability. Without reliable input, an instructor cannot adequately assist the academic development of a student. If a student is unsure about the use of some material or about the appropriateness of its use, that student should consult the instructor supervising the assignment. The following list provides an overview of some situations that are considered cheating and/or plagiarism at GSSM: 1. The verbatim reproduction of the content of any source that is not original as if it were your own. 2. The reproduction or rephrasing of an article, essay, document, idea, or any other non-original source as if it were your own. 3. The use of any thought, research, organization of material, presentation, or phrasing of another person as if it were your own. 4. The use of another person's laboratory data or conclusions without documenting that use. 5. Any collaboration on assignments that are supposed to be completed independently. 6. Copying the work or answers of others on assignments or tests. 7. The use of crib sheets or other resource materials that are not permitted by the instructor. 8. The assimilation of ideas from many sources is basic to academic research and intellectual development. At GSSM it is imperative that students identify all sources used in the development of an idea. Only when students provide credit where credit is due can their instructors do the same for them. Faculty will routinely use tools such as Turn-It-In, etc. to check for material plagiarized from the Internet. 18 N. Summer Program for Research Interns (SPRI) One of the most distinctive learning experiences for GSSM students is the Summer Program for Research Interns (SPRI), coordinated through the Center for Science Education and Outreach. It begins with six full weeks of research during the summer following the junior year. Most students conduct research in a university lab, in the field, or in an industry research facility under the direction and guidance of a professional scientist, researcher, or engineer. Students work with their research mentor and a faculty advisor during the senior year to complete and analyze their research findings. All students write an academic research paper and make formal presentations at state and regional scientific meetings. O. Community Engagement The Governor's School for Science and Mathematics views the Community Engagement service requirement as an appropriate and essential response on the part of GSSM students to the generosity of the state in providing an exceptional GSSM education. Service, whether within the context of the residence hall, faculty/staff assistance, or community service, is emerging as one of the evidences of maturity sought in college admissions and has become an important requirement of many public and private secondary schools. Satisfactory completion of this service is a GSSM graduation requirement. Any student deficient in hours at the end of any grading period may lose weekend leave privileges until the appropriate hours have been completed. The program is currently under review, but students typically complete three hours of service per week for a total of 83 hours each year. An attempt is made to give each student an assignment in which he/she has indicated an interest, but there are some expectations beyond the primary assignment. In many cases, the supervisor will have a variety of tasks in which assistance is needed. Students should be as faithful to community engagement as they are to their classes. The Community Engagement program is administered through the Office of the Vice President for Student Development. Questions regarding this requirement should be directly to the Community Engagement Coordinator. P. Classroom Cell Phone Policy Cell phones are not allowed in classrooms during instructional time. Refer to the cell phone policy under Life on Campus for more discussion. Q. Meetings and Assemblies Unexcused absences from required meetings and assemblies will be considered an infraction and will be sanctioned accordingly. Decorum for attendance at meetings and assemblies includes the following: 1. Students may not wear hats/baseball caps. 2. Students must remain awake and alert for the entire program. 3. Students must exhibit courteous and appropriate behavior that includes, but is not limited to, no talking, eating, drinking, whispering, passing notes, or feet up on chairs or railings, etc. 4. Students may not wear or use headphones and should not bring electronic devices to an assembly meeting. 5. Students are expected to attend all mandatory assemblies and to be on time. 19 6. Faculty and/or staff members may cite a student for inappropriate behavior during an assembly. R. January Interim As part of the GSSM graduation requirements, students are required to enroll and successfully complete two interim courses, one during their junior and senior years. The courses vary in content and fee If a student registers for a course that has a fee, the student is responsible for payment in full for the course, even if he/she later withdraws or is dismissed from GSSM prior to or during Interim. If this occurs, there is no reimbursement for payments made and the student remains responsible for the full payment. 20 IV. STUDYING ON CAMPUS AND LIBRARY USE A. QUEST QUEST is defined as Quality Uninterrupted Enforced Study Time and is required for all students. QUEST is from 8 pm – 10 pm, Sunday – Thursday. Non-academic activities may not be held during QUEST. During QUEST, quiet co-ed study is allowed in the dining hall and South lobby. Students may also QUEST quietly in the residence hall lounges or silently in the Reading Room which is staffed by Student Council members. During QUEST, the entire school is expected to be devoted to silent study, with the exception of the dining hall and South lobby where students may consult quietly with each other. Students are allowed to go quietly to and from the Language Lab or faculty directed study and help sessions as needed during QUEST. During QUEST, student room doors must be fully open. All music should be listened to on headphones. Students are not permitted to talk on phones, watch television or movies, play games, etc. when they are QUESTing. Activities distracting to others (playing music audibly, socializing in hallways, etc.) are not permitted. Students are allowed to do laundry during QUEST, as long as the time spent in the laundry room is limited to starting or removing laundry. Students may not QUEST off campus. Studying takes precedence over all social activities during QUEST (e.g. senior privileges during Spring Semester). If someone asks you to be quiet, turn off TV/game, or move loud study groups, you must comply. This includes all lounges, classrooms, and public areas. Failure to comply with QUEST or ConQuest guidelines will result in QUEST violations and the following consequences will apply: First violation – Student meets with the VPAA at the time the VPAA designates via an email to the student. Student will be required to QUEST in the room the evening after the meeting. This will be considered a Level 1 violation. Subsequent violations – Student meets with the VPAA at the time VPAA designates via an email to the student. Student will be required to QUEST in the room two evening after the meeting and parents will be contacted. This will be considered a Level 1 violation. B. ConQUEST (CONcentrated QUEST) To help our environment be more conducive to study in the building during finals, the following ConQUEST guidelines will be in effect each semester from 8:00 pm on Reading Day until all students have finished exams: 1. 'Lights Out' is suspended for study purposes only during ConQuest. If one roommate is sleeping, the other must go to the lounge to study to allow ‘lights out’ in the room for sleeping. ‘Lights out’ may be reinstated if the noise level gets too loud and students are not able to get sleep or study. (See Lights Out section on page 21.) 2. The computer network is available from 6:00 am until Midnight during exams. 3. The only time acceptable for NORMAL noise level is from 7:00 - 8:00 pm and 10:00 - 10:30 pm. 4. All games and outdoor activities must be held away from building in the grassy area behind the building so that other students are not disturbed or distracted. 21 5. Any noise that can be heard outside an individual room (with the door open or closed) or is distracting is not permitted. This includes loud talking, music, computer games, video games, physical activity, etc. Areas include (but are NOT limited to) hallways, lounges, the lobby, stairways, and in front or in back of the building. 6. Studying takes precedence over all social activities during ConQUEST. If someone asks you to be quiet, turn off TV/game or move loud study groups, you must comply. This includes all lounges, classrooms, and public areas. 7. Students may not watch TV during normal QUEST hours and after 10:30 pm. 8. If you wish to listen to music in the lounge you will need to use headphones and the volume should be low enough so another person cannot hear the music. 9. Lounge and cell phones may not be used during normal QUEST times. 10. Violation of ConQUEST is considered an infringement of another’s right to study and will be responded to and sanctioned appropriately. C. Pre-QUEST Study Hall Policies The purpose of the Pre-QUEST Study Hall is to reduce distractions, intensify efforts, and encourage better study habits so grades will improve. Students who need this kind of academic support will have their progress reviewed to make certain that they will be able to complete the GSSM requirements. 1. Procedure a. After each grading period (Fall mid-term, Fall semester and Spring mid-term) all students with a D and/or three or more C’s will automatically be placed in the Pre-QUEST Study Hall. b. Instructors may place students in the Pre-QUEST Study Hall at any time by submitting a written Academic Deficiency Report of unsatisfactory progress in a course to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Students so assigned must remain in Pre-QUEST until its conclusion. c. Written notice via email and/or report card will be given to the students who are placed in the Pre-QUEST Study Hall. Parents will receive notice via the report card. d. The Vice President for Academic Affairs or designee will report the names of all students who are in the study hall to the faculty and staff. 2. Effective Dates After the mid-terms of both semesters, Pre-QUEST will begin after all grades have been reported and distributed to students which will most often be during the week following the end of the grading period and continue for four weeks. Pre-QUEST after the Fall semester will begin the first night of Spring semester after interim and continue for four weeks. The study hall will be suspended only by scheduled GSSM events such as holidays, interims, or school-wide activities. In such case(s), the study hall will resume once the normal GSSM schedule resumes. 3. Requirements a. The student must attend Pre-QUEST for four (4) consecutive weeks. Pre-QUEST will run Monday through Thursday from 5:30 – 6:45 pm, with the exception of long weekends or holidays. 22 b. Students will be excused from study hall to attend language lab or astronomy lab. Students may also attend teacher-led study sessions in any of their courses if the teacher turns in their names to the Pre-QUEST proctor in advance with date, time, and location listed. c. Failure to meet attendance requirements is subject to the discipline code as a Level 1 disciplinary offense. Missed time in Pre-Quest will result in having to attend make-up PreQuest days at the end of Pre-Quest. 4. Limitation of Activities Students on Pre-QUEST may not participate in any organized club activities or events Sunday – Thursday. They may not participate in competitive sports during the four-week period. With the permission of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Director of Athletics, students may be allowed to practice with their teams twice during the week in lieu of intramurals, but may not participate in any competitions. Exceptions may be considered during playoff games, but approval by the Director of Athletics, the Vice President for Student Development, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs must be granted before these decisions are finalized. Additionally, only the required minimum number of service hours may be completed during this period. 5. Academic Review The Academic Review Committee will meet after each grading period to review all students, especially those who are on Pre-QUEST. The ARC will determine their academic eligibility. Please refer to the section on Academic Eligibility. 6. Exceptions Waivers to the policies above may be granted under unusual circumstances after a request is submitted in writing to the Academic Review Committee. D. Lights Out Extensions On occasion, students may have a need to stay up to study past Lights Out. If this occurs, students may request Lights Out Extensions for group study or to study outside of their rooms. (There will be a limit on the number of extensions granted per student.) In order to receive a Lights Out Extension, the student must sign up for one with the Residence Life Coordinator on duty before 10:30 p.m. on the night they wish to receive the extension. If granted, the student will then be allowed to stay up until a designated time as long as it does not interfere with the roommate’s ability to sleep or prove disruptive to other residents. Once the extension is over, the student must turn out all lights and follow all guidelines for Lights Out. If students feel they need more than four Lights Out Extensions a semester, they should meet with their Academic Advisor or the Vice President for Academic Affairs for academic or time management counseling. E. Library Use GSSM students may use the Charles W. and Joan S. Coker Library-Information Technology Center at Coker College for research. This 40,000 square foot facility hosts an expanded print collection, electronic databases, WiFi, computer kiosks, and a café. Research librarians are available at the Coker College library during mornings and afternoons to assist with locating resources and devising research strategies. Students are encouraged to use this valuable resource in the early phases of their research projects. GSSM students may use all print and electronic resources in the library. Up to five items may be checked out at any time, with the exception of DVDs, CDs, and reference materials, which must be used in the library. Students may renew checked out items once, but all materials must be returned to the library by their due date and prior to the end of the GSSM semester in which it was borrowed. 23 An extensive collection of research databases and electronic catalogs are available online in the library and via the Internet. Accessing these resources via the Internet requires a username and password provided by the school. Students may use library computers for research and catalog access, but may not use them to compose or edit assignments. However, students may bring their own computers for this purpose. See the library staff at the circulation desk for information about how to connect to the college's wireless network. Students visiting the Coker Library are representatives of GSSM and should conduct themselves accordingly. All GSSM rules concerning conduct remain in effect when visiting the library. Coker College rules and policies are also applicable to visiting GSSM students. Coker College may deny access to its library facilities to anyone who violates their published rules and policies. GSSM students will exercise care with all library materials and will return all materials checked out when they are due. Students are responsible for paying any fees or fines assessed by the library. Coker’s circulation policies may be found online at http://www.coker.edu/library. Students who visit the library will observe GSSM policies regarding walking off-campus described in Chapter VII, Leaving Campus, in this handbook. As with most colleges and universities, Internet access at Coker College is not filtered to prevent access to pornographic or other inappropriate content. GSSM rules prohibiting student access to pornographic or other inappropriate content also apply when using the Coker College library or any other college or university when the student is representing GSSM. 24 V. LIFE ON CAMPUS A. Residence Life Staff The Residence Life staff members, who live in the residence hall, are responsible for supporting the school’s mission by directing, guiding, and supervising the students, particularly in areas of non-academic development. Their mission is to support the students’ academic efforts and to guide their mastery of the art of combining rigorous work with a rewarding, healthy, and balanced life. The staff provides emotional support and social and recreational opportunities. They also respond to student concerns, set standards for acceptable behavior, interpret and enforce school policies, respond to problems and conflicts, and administer discipline when necessary. The residence life staff is in charge of the day-to-day operation of the residence life program and, with administrative support, has responsibility for decision-making in this area. The Residence Life Coordinators (RLCs) are professional full-time staff members who live in the residence hall. They participate in all faculty/staff meetings and are charged with representing the concerns of students regarding residential life. In addition to the professional staff, Resident Assistants (RAs) serve as mentors, plan hall activities, help enforce guidelines, and act as liaisons between the students and staff. RAs are local college students and are chosen for their maturity, leadership, communication skills, and interest in working with teenagers. B. Room Check Room check occurs Sunday – Thursday at 10:30 pm and Friday and Saturday at 12 am. The following are the guidelines for room check: 1. Students must be at their room door for room check. (This applies to the first few weeks of school. After convocation students may be at their suitemates’ door.) 2. Students must stand at the door for room check until the Resident Assistant verifies their presence. 3. Students who go to sleep prior to room check must put a note on the door for the RA. RAs will verify that the student is indeed in his/her room asleep. 4. Information on students who are late for room check will be documented by the Residence Life Staff. This is a violation of GSSM policy and will be handled accordingly. 5. Students will be asked to present their student identification cards during the first two weeks of the school year. Afterwards, student IDs may be checked periodically during the day. Whenever asked, students are required to present the cards upon request. C. Lights Out Lights Out begins at 12 midnight and ends at 6:00 a.m. the following morning on Sunday through Thursday. Students may not be outside of their rooms during these hours, and it is the expectation that rooms be in a state conducive for sleep (e.g. overhead and obtrusive lights out, music off, etc.). All students are expected to respect the rights of community members regarding sleep and quiet. Students are also reminded of the importance of getting proper sleep and its impact on their health and overall wellness. They are strongly encouraged to be in bed during these hours. GSSM acknowledges that there may be occasions when a student’s academic workload requires that they work beyond midnight. With proper time management, these occasions should be rare and generally avoidable. Students are encouraged to maximize their time between classes, planning ahead and not waiting until the last minute or QUEST to begin their out-of-class academic preparation. 25 Again, students are not allowed out of their rooms after midnight and it should be completely quiet in the residence hall. Exceptions will be Lights Out Extensions, which can be requested through the residence life staff on duty any evening. If students are found outside of their rooms without authorization, being loud, and not maintaining the spirit of Lights Out as outlined above, staff will address this conduct. Additionally, if reports are made that indicate that students are not adhering to this policy (e.g. complaints from other students, concerns regarding class attendance, tardiness, lack of engagement, etc.) from community members including parents, members of the staff will follow up and periodically check on them, exercising GSSM’s responsibility to address policy violations in keeping with the school’s honor code. Students who have been reported by community members will be notified prior to this follow up. Internet and email access is turned off Monday through Friday from midnight until 6:00 a.m. There is no "off" time from Friday at 6:00 a.m. until Sunday at midnight. D. Quiet Hours and Consideration Hours During Quiet Hours, students are to be quiet and residents undisturbed, specifically from 12 midnight to 6:00 a.m. This also includes QUEST and the time between Room Check and Lights Out. All other hours of the day, 6:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. are Consideration Hours where everyone is expected to be respectful and considerate of his/her neighbor, including those on the hall and in areas above and/or below student rooms. Students socializing in lounges and other common areas are expected to be mindful of Quiet Hours and Consideration Hours. E. Residence Hall and Common Area Shared Housekeeping Responsibilities 1. Each student is responsible for the upkeep of the residence hall floors, including rooms, hallways, bathrooms, and lounges. 2. Students will be placed on a “suite rotation” for common areas upstairs. Areas to be cleaned on a rotation include the stairwells and elevators, lounges, hallways, and laundry rooms. 3. Clean common areas are the responsibility of all GSSM residents. Lounges determined to be excessively dirty or “trashed” (i.e., food remnants not properly thrown away, scattered newspapers, dirty dishes left in the lounge) will be closed for no less than 24 hours. The lounge may be closed for longer periods as deemed appropriate by the RLC or RA on the floor. While suite rotation is assigned to the lounges for general clean up, residents are expected to clean up after themselves. 4. Students’ personal items left in the hallway should be moved by midnight. Any items left after Lights Out may be picked up by staff and students might be required to assist with hall cleaning or other community chores before items are returned. 5. The Clean Campus Committee (CCC) shall oversee the tidiness of the downstairs area of the GSSM campus, as well as to raise student awareness concerning the need to take responsibility for personal belongings and to maintain clean surroundings. a. If a student assigned CCC duty for leaving an item downstairs misses the night after his or her item(s) was (were) found, he or she will have to complete two nights of CCC duty. Students will be informed by the RLC on Duty each evening via email if they have been assigned CCC. b. If a student assigned CCC duty for leaving an item downstairs misses two nights after his or her item(s) was (were) found, he or she will have to complete three nights of CCC duty. 26 c. If a student assigned CCC duty for leaving an item downstairs misses three nights after his or her item(s) was (were) found, a Level 1 will be given to him or her for failure to follow instructions. d. Special cases i. If a student assigned CCC duty falls ill, is not at the school during the designated time when CCC is to be performed, or is being disciplined in some way that impedes his or her attending CCC, the student will not be punished, but will be allowed to complete their duty the first night they are free from the aforementioned restrictions. If they fail to attend, they will be subject to the consequences mentioned above. ii. If a student who has missed one or two nights of CCC completes their duty, yet his or her belongings are found the same night, he or she shall again be required to complete CCC duty, with the same consequences for missing nights. F. Room Inspections and Cleanliness 1. Room and Hall inspections will be conducted at least once a week to ensure student rooms and halls meet the health, safety, and cleanliness standards established by the school and health and fire safety authorities. 2. Students are required to pass these inspections. They will be scheduled on a regular day and time to be determined at the beginning of each school year. Students on each hall will be informed as to whether or not they passed inspection in a manner to be determined by the hall staff at the beginning of the school year. Students may review the inspection records if they have questions about past inspections. Whenever possible, they will not conflict with suite rotations. Closed areas and refrigerators may be opened for visual inspection (see Room Inspection Form). Note that failure to pass room inspections may be subject to disciplinary action. 3. For reasons of health and safety, GSSM reserves the right to conduct inspections in students’ rooms during any vacation period (see details in #5 below). 4. Roommates and suitemates are responsible for their shared living areas. When individual responsibility cannot be easily determined, students will be held equally responsible for substandard cleanliness or illegal items in their living areas. If a student is aware of a problem in their shared living area, he/she should notify a Residence Life Staff member promptly. 5. Pre-inspections will occur on the evenings prior to breaks for all residents. All items on the Room Inspection Form will be reviewed. Custodial closets will also be checked. 6. White glove inspections will occur during Long Weekends and the closing day for all other breaks. Resident Assistants will conduct the inspections after all students have left for Long Weekend or break. Requirements for white glove inspection extend beyond what students must complete for routine room inspection (see Room Inspection Form below): 27 Room Inspection Form Items checked during Weekly Inspection ___ bathtub scrubbed ___ sink (dishes) cleaned ___ shower wall scrubbed ___ trash emptied ___ toilet cleaned ___ floor free of dirt, trash ___ mirror cleaned Additional items to be checked for White Glove inspection (over long weekends): ___ lights off/blinds closed ___ refrigerator cleaned Items to be checked off over Christmas Holidays and Spring Break: ___ stereos, clocks, lamps, computers unplugged ___ campus mail box emptied Room found unsatisfactory by:___________________ To be re-inspected on _________ at __________ by ____________________ G. Residence Hall Room Decorations and Furnishings 1. The names of room occupants must be clearly displayed on the room doors during the entire year with the nametags furnished by Residence Life. 2. Arrangement of furniture must meet basic safety requirements and guidelines established by the Residence Life staff. All furniture must remain in the room and on the floor at all times. No cinder blocks are allowed in the rooms. 3. No obscene, offensive, or pornographic materials may be displayed. 4. Road and/or building signs are not permitted in student rooms or common rooms and will be confiscated if found. 5. The Residence Life staff reserves the right to determine appropriate decoration of rooms, doors, and hallways. Community-wide posters and notices are to be mounted on bulletin boards only. 6. Lounge, lobby, activity room, and classroom furnishing must not be moved from their designated areas. 7. Thumbtacks or push pins are to be used to hang posters, photos, etc. on the room walls. DO NOT USE TAPE OF ANY KIND ON THE WALLS. Duct tape is especially damaging to the walls and doors and should never be used. 8. Televisions and DVD players are provided in the student lounge. Students may not have televisions and DVD players in their rooms. Students may not move TVs and DVD players without approval from the Residence Life Staff. 9. Nintendo, Playstation, XBOX, Wii consoles, etc. may be hooked up to televisions in the TV Lounge; students should avoid leaving their equipment unattended. 28 10. Each student is permitted to have a refrigerator, but it must be no larger than a “dorm size” or personal refrigerator. 11. Stereo equipment is allowed and students are encouraged to bring headphones to avoid noise violations. 12. Residence hall rooms are not to be used for music practice. Amplifiers should never be used in the residence hall rooms. GSSM does not provide storage for musical instruments; however, some arrangements may be considered for larger instruments. 13. Students are allowed to keep and use personal computers in the residence hall; however, monitors are limited to 36 inches and only one monitor is permitted per student. Requests for exceptions to this requirement must be made in writing to the Director of Campus Life and approved by the chair of the math and computer science department for consideration. An explanation as to why a larger and/or multiple monitors is/are necessary is required before bringing them to campus. 14. Fish are the only pets permitted for students living in the residence hall. They are restricted to living within a 10-gallon aquarium and must be taken home over long weekends or breaks. Students’ personal pets cannot be stored or maintained in science laboratories or in any place on GSSM property. 15. High lofts are not allowed. Bunking and low lofting the beds as they are designed is permitted with the use of steel pins provided by the Residence Life Coordinators. In bunking beds, two pin openings above the level at which the bed is bunked must be left. 16. Athletic and recreation equipment (including, but not limited to, footballs, baseballs, water guns, nerf guns, potato guns, and basketballs) cannot be used inside the building. 17. Candles, incense, irons, heating elements (e.g. hot plates, woks, coffee makers, hot pots, etc.), electrical appliances, halogen lights without protective screens over the bulb, or any kind of open flames producing device are not allowed in the residence hall. 18. Strings of lights are not permitted. 19. Students should not cover more than 10% of any one wall with printed materials. Posters and other printed materials may not be placed in the hallways. 20. Sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, or light fixtures must be left free of things hung on them or covering them. 21. Curtains and other wall hangings may be used for decorative purposes, but must be treated with a fire retardant solution before hung in the residence hall. Black out curtains are not permitted and will be confiscated upon discovery. 22. Ceiling tiles should not be removed and items are not to be stored in the ceiling. H. Telephones Phones are available for student use in all residence hall TV lounges. No one is assigned to answer phones in the lounges. Students are allowed to use the phones during the day until midnight Sunday – Thursday and 1:00 am on Friday and Saturday nights except for QUEST (8-10 pm study time) and while on in-room curfew. All calls must be limited to a maximum of 20 minutes to allow others on the hall access to the lounge phone. If parents need to contact a student during restricted use time, please call the Residence Life Coordinator on duty and the message will be relayed. Students may not use GSSM  29 office and residential staff telephones without permission. The courtesy telephone in the lobby is for official business and short local calls only. These calls must not exceed three minutes. I. Cell Phones GSSM students are allowed to have cell phones for personal use. All students are responsible for following the cell phone guidelines established by GSSM. 1. All cell phone numbers must be reported to the Residence Life Staff to keep on file in case of an emergency. GSSM staff may call students on their cell phones when necessary. In addition, GSSM's emergency notification system may send voice and SMS messages to student cell phones during emergencies and drills. Contacting students via cell phone is necessary for student safety; therefore, if such calls and alerts cause students to incur additional cell phone charges, GSSM will not provide reimbursement. 2. Responsibility for appropriate use of cell phones lies with the student; responsibility for monitoring use for appropriateness lies jointly with the GSSM staff and parents of the students. 3. Possession of a cell phone on the GSSM campus is a privilege that may be lost if abused. 4. The right of a student to have a telephone conversation is subordinate to the rights of other students to have quiet and undistracted times for study and sleep. Therefore, cell phones may not be used in classrooms, during QUEST, or during sleeping hours. Cell phones may be used outside, or in rooms or common areas if those areas are not in use by others for incompatible purposes. Cell phones are not to be used after midnight Sunday through Thursday in keeping with GSSM’s “Lights Out” policy. 5. Telephone conversations are private and may not be monitored, as governed by state or federal law. 6. Without being unduly intrusive into residence hall life, GSSM cannot monitor all cell phone usage. Therefore: a. GSSM is not responsible for loss or theft of cell phones. b. GSSM is not responsible for unauthorized use of a cell phone. c. Cell phones are the financial responsibility of the student and his/her parent or guardian. 7. Most parents are well aware that teenagers sometimes feel the need to have extremely long telephone conversations, even at the expense of sleep or study time. GSSM is also aware that students can be very persuasive; they may get roommates to tolerate these conversations, even though the roommate gives up sleep or study time as well, to the detriment of the health and good academic standing of both. For this reason, parents are urged to monitor the monthly cell phone statement, to determine the times at which calls are placed. A timely discussion with the student can prevent academic difficulties before they start. Students should also be coached on how to get help if a roommate persists in inappropriate behavior. 8. Cell phones are not allowed in classrooms during instructional time. Violation of this rule is a Level 2 offense. If a cell phone is discovered during a test or quiz, the student may also be found in violation of our Honor Code, as it may not be clear whether the student was using the phone to share or store information related to the test. 9. Students who are QUESTing may not use their cell phones. 30 10. Students may not use their cell phones or similar devices to provide Internet access to themselves or others after lights out, or otherwise circumvent the school’s Appropriate Use Policy (AUP). 11. Violation of cell phone use is categorized as a Level 2 offense. These matters will be addressed in keeping GSSM”s Discipline and Honor Code. J. Mail Service GSSM students will receive mail and packages at the GSSM campus. You must use your given name in the address. Improperly addressed mail, including use of parents' names, etc., will not be delivered. Your address will be: Student Name, GSSM, 401 Railroad Avenue, Hartsville, SC 29550 Each student has a campus (in-house) mailbox and each room is assigned a USPS mailbox, which will be shared with his or her roommate. USPS mailboxes are located in Room A141 near the Nurse’s Office. US mail will be delivered to boxes once a day. If you receive a package, you will be notified by email. You may also check the package delivery list at the front desk for any received packages. Campus (in-house) mailboxes (cubbies) are located in A136 and are for internal communication only. No other items may be stored in or on top of the mailbox (e.g. books, calculators, etc.). Because this is the main source of communication, these mailboxes should be checked every day. K. Personal Finance Students are encouraged to open a personal bank account with one of the banks in Hartsville. Local merchants may not accept out-of-town checks, and there may be other occasions where a local account would be beneficial to the student. Students are strongly encouraged not to keep large sums of money in the residence hall. Students with significant financial concerns are encouraged to discuss their concerns privately with a Residence Life Coordinator, the Director of Campus Life, or the Vice President for Student Development. L. Inter-visitation (Interviz) Interviz is supervised visitation on the male and female sides of the residential portion of the GSSM building. Time and place for Interviz will be determined by the RLC on duty. The following are guidelines for Interviz: 1. Resident Assistants will be posted at the hall door during Interviz. All students participating in Interviz must surrender their student ID card while participating. When a student is ready to leave Interviz, he/she must see the RA on the floor to have his/her ID returned. 2. All rooms with students participating in Interviz must have the doors completely open. 3. A light source needs to be on in the room at all times. A computer monitor does not count as a light source. 4. Bunk beds cannot have sheets or coverings hanging that block the view of the bottom bunk. 5. Students may not use the restroom in an opposite gender suite. 6. Ten minutes before the conclusion of Interviz, students will be notified that ten minutes of Interviz remain. All students of the opposite sex must check out with the RA as they leave the hall. 31 7. Students are responsible for ensuring that other students do not enter the rooms of those not participating in Interviz. 8. All Public Display of Affections (PDAs; see next section) and visitation guidelines are in effect during Interviz. 9. After three violations of Interviz, the privilege may be revoked from the entire student body. M. Public Displays of Affection Inappropriate public displays of affection (PDA) are not permitted because they are embarrassing to students, faculty, and staff members who have to view them. Engaging in inappropriate displays will result in disciplinary action. Ordinarily, students will not be permitted to sit in public areas or student rooms with the lights off. Public areas include, but are not limited to: all lounges, classrooms, the lobby, the activity area, or any area visible to the public. During Intervisitation, student room doors must be open completely and a major light source must be on. A major light source (excluding televisions and computer monitors) must also be on in all lounge areas. The following guidelines are not all-inclusive, but are to be used as a guide for permissible behavior. While violation of PDA guidelines is a Level 1 offense, subsequent recurrences of PDA violations may result in more severe sanctions than listed as Level 1, and some displays of affection may rise to higher levels of offense with correspondingly more severe sanctions (see Discipline). Inappropriate PDAs include: 1. Petting or caressing. 2. Prolonged kissing. 3. Inappropriate massages (any area other than the back, shoulders, and neck). 4. Being in a horizontal position with another person. 5. Having your head on or in someone's lap. Sitting on someone’s lap. 6. Any kind of sexual intimacy or contact. 7. Sharing a blanket with another student. 8. Any other type of unlisted display that causes the viewer discomfort or embarrassment is considered inappropriate. N. Sunbathing GSSM does permit students to sunbathe on the campus. Sunbathing is limited to the areas behind the building. Students are to follow the GSSM dress code when sunbathing. Cover-ups (t-shirts and/or shorts) must be worn at all times when not sunbathing, including to and from the building and inside the building. Students are not permitted to play sports or activities while wearing swimwear on the GSSM campus. O. Movies and Video Games The GSSM Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty, and Staff are committed to providing a wholesome atmosphere for everyone in the GSSM community, as well as complying with laws related to age for viewing movies and other similarly rated material. GSSM students may not view “R” or “Unrated” materials or play “M” rated video games in public areas. These materials may not be viewed in the dining hall, television lounges, or the Student Activity Center. R-rated material may be used in the classroom if  32 the instructor deems such material appropriate for the course or during a program sponsored by Residence Life. The instructor or staff member will be present at the viewing of all R-rated material. Parents are encouraged to give students who are 17 years or older guidance on viewing R-rated movies on their personal computers, in television lounges, or at local theaters, as well as the use of M-rated video games on their personal computers. THE VIEWING OF X AND AO RATED VIDEO MATERIAL IS PROHIBITED. In addition, GSSM recognizes the potential for a student to play video games excessively, to the detriment of the student’s academic standing and good health through loss of study time, exercise, and sleep. Parents are encouraged to keep video game consoles at home, and to prohibit students from loading games onto their personal computers. GSSM does not disallow video games; we will encourage students to monitor themselves and others to support healthy, limited use of these leisure activities. P. Employment Due to the rigorous curriculum, students may not hold full or part-time jobs while attending GSSM. 33 VI. SAFETY AND SECURITY A. Emergencies and Parent Contact In case of an emergency, parents should contact the Residence Life Coordinator cell phone at 843-858- 1603, 24 hours a day while school is in session. Depending on the emergency, you may also contact our on duty security officer at 843-992-0377. All parents and GSSM students should enter these emergency contact numbers in their cell phones in case they are needed. For non-emergencies the Residence Life Coordinator on duty can be contacted at 843-383-3901, extension 3931 from 9 am to 12 midnight on weekdays and 6 pm to 12 midnight on weekends. 1. Throughout the year the Residence Life staff and/or the Director of Campus Life will contact parents when appropriate. For example, parents might be contacted if a student receives medical attention beyond what is provided by the GSSM nurse or if there is a gross violation of the disciplinary code. 2. Students are expected to communicate with their parents on a regular basis to keep them informed on personal, academic, social, and discipline issues. We encourage all parents to set up a calling schedule with their student so there are clear expectations set prior to attending GSSM. At times, it may be necessary to contact the RLC on duty to request that your son or daughter call home, but this should be done on a very limited basis. 3. GSSM uses an emergency contact service to communicate critical safety information to students and parents if needed. It is important that students and parents notify the school of changes to home, work, and cell phone numbers so they can be informed in the event of a campus emergency. B. Emergency Actions and Drills 1. Crisis Intervention Procedures It is vitally important that every student knows what to do in the event of an emotional crisis or medical emergency. You are to follow the procedures as outlined below: a. The most important priority is to get help for the victim. Send someone for help or use your cell phone to call for help. Don't leave the person unattended unless there is no other means of getting help. It is vital to the individual's health and safety that they not be left alone. b. You must get in touch with the Nurse, Residence Life Coordinator on duty, the Director of Campus Life, Psychologist, or the Vice President for Student Development. As soon as one of the above or their designee arrives, you are released. 2. Fire Drills/ Fire Alarm Procedure Fire drills will be held monthly. The Residence Life staff will provide detailed instructions. Respond seriously and promptly to these emergency procedures. Students should familiarize themselves with the fire alarm procedure as posted on their door. When the fire alarm sounds, students should do the following: a. Immediately exit the building using nearest stairwell and report to the front of the building. b. Girls should report immediately to the grass near the C Wing. c. Boys should report immediately to the grass close to the student parking lot. d. Students with mobility issues who cannot or should not use the stairs should communicate with Security via the intercom. Someone will be designated to assist to them. e. Remain at your designated location until a member of the Residence Life staff takes roll and gives you further instructions. 34 3. Tornados / Go To A Safe Place When dangerous weather is imminently approaching GSSM, school officials will determine the course of action by carefully monitoring weather reports. If it is determined that GSSM students could be in danger, we will announce over the school-wide intercom system to “GO TO A SAFE PLACE.” For these dangerous weather occurrences our designated “safe places” are the inside stairwells leading to the residential wings of our building. While not particularly comfortable, these areas are structurally among the sturdiest and they are free of window glass. Dangerous weather and “Go to a safe place” drills are held each semester. When you hear the “GO TO A SAFE PLACE” announcement, you should: a. Immediately report to the inside stairwells. (Boys should report to the “A” side stairwell and Girls should report to the “B” side stairwell.) b. Roll will be taken in the stairwells. c. Remain calm and in the stairwells until you are given further instructions from a GSSM official. 4. Armed Intruder Alert In the unlikely event there is an armed intruder at GSSM, we have an alert to notify our community that there is a threat on our campus. While no plan can cover every contingency or situation, planning actions beforehand can increase our security if such an unlikely threatening event occurs. Students are trained to shelter in place when they hear the alert. We practice this drill at least one time a semester or as often as necessary. Our procedure is as follows: a. The following statement will be announced on the public address system: “Mr. Greenland please report to the library or the YMCA.” b. This announcement will normally be followed by a text message to all students’ cell phones through our emergency notification system. c. If in a lockable area, lock the door and remain until further instructions. d. If in an open area, go to the nearest lockable area and remain until further instructions. e. If in the North, South, Main lobby, or hallways, go to the nearest securable area or exit the building and go to the YMCA. f. If in the Dining Hall, proceed into kitchen area for lockdown. g. If outside, go to the YMCA. h. Stay in the secure location until the “all clear“ is given on the public address system. C. Campus Security Everyone plays a role in campus security. Students and staff are to report any suspicious persons to the Residence Life Coordinator immediately. A security guard is on duty 4 pm – 8 am Monday – Friday and 24 hours a day Saturday and Sunday. The guard will be posted at the desk in the main lobby. Guards will make rounds throughout the campus and monitor the safety of the campus. Security can be reached at 843-992-0377. All exterior residence hall doors are locked after room check each night. The rear fire exit stairwells are alarmed continuously. The main lobby doors are the only doors through which students are to enter and exit the building. Residence hall rooms should be locked unless a student is present in the room. Please note the Residence Life staff does not condone leaving your door open or unlocked for any reason. Locking your door adds to student safety and security of person and property. Students should avoid entering another student’s room without permission. A multi-camera digital recording system is installed throughout the GSSM campus for the protection of the students and to provide a safe residential environment. The system in common areas upstairs is not monitored in real-time. Access to this system is extremely limited and all students’ rights to privacy are protected. The Director of Campus Life will conduct periodic checks of the system to ensure the system is operating properly. The upstairs monitoring system will be accessed if there is an event that makes  35 looking at the footage necessary (fire alarms, vandalism, thefts, etc.). If the footage is viewed, the viewing will be only of that segment of time in which the event likely occurred. The initial review will be conducted by either the Director of Campus Life or the Vice President for Student Development, or their designees. The initial screening will be to determine if there are any images that need to be isolated. These frames will then be provided, as necessary, to appropriate school officials, the Judicial Council, and any students and/or parents involved when it is deemed appropriate. Should any event require the involvement of the fire or police departments, those agencies will have access to the unedited version of the images. The downstairs system is monitored in real time by GSSM staff or security. No footage is kept on videotape. The system digitally records the images until pictures are isolated and transferred on disk. There is no hard copy of the footage. There will be no long-term storage of the data from either system. D. Privacy, Search and Seizure A student’s right to privacy is respected at GSSM. However, GSSM also has a responsibility to maintain standards of safety and behavior that are reflected in GSSM regulations and policies, and local, state, and federal statutes. In the event that a staff member needs to check on a student (e.g. illness, not showing up for class, violation of lights out, etc.), staff members are permitted to enter a room to locate a student. Staff members will knock and announce themselves prior to entering the room. If there is no answer, the staff member is authorized to enter the room to locate the student. GSSM may authorize searches, based on “probable cause” and the “reasonableness standard” applicable to public schools, of a student's residence hall mailbox, room including personal belongings, automobile, and other areas, when there is suspicion that violations have occurred. If possible, such entry and search will be made in the presence of the student or students involved, provided the students can be located in a timely fashion. When a student’s room is to be searched, staff members of the same gender will be assigned to perform the search. When such a search is deemed necessary, parents will be contacted as soon as possible. Persons conducting the entry and search will not enter a student’s room or access a student’s property without first knocking on the door, identifying themselves, and announcing the purpose of their visit. If they are not admitted, a master key will be used. If the student or students cannot be located, the person authorized to do the search will be accompanied by another GSSM official and a student witness or the room will be completely sealed until contact has been made. However, it should be noted that a GSSM official may enter any GSSM premise or search GSSM property at any time when the immediate safety of persons or property is involved. If contraband items used in criminal acts or stolen property is found during the search, it will be confiscated and a written receipt will be given to the room’s occupants. Should local, state, and/or federal law enforcement officers present a duly authorized warrant, or when such officials have determined that circumstances exist which justify an unwarranted search, GSSM will cooperate in allowing such a search. A GSSM official will be present during the search unless otherwise ordered by the law enforcement officers. E. Fire Safety Regulations in the Residence Hall 1. Candles, incense, irons, heating elements (e.g. hot plates, woks, coffee pots, water boilers, etc.), electrical appliances, halogen lights without protective screens over the bulb, and any kind of open flame or flame-producing device (including matches, lighters, lit cigarettes, cigars, or pipes of any kind) are not allowed in the residence hall. 36 2.

During the weekday evenings and Saturdays and Sundays, students will need to use their cards at all times to open the doors of the main lobby. G. Student Identification Cards Each student will receive a picture identification card, which serves as the student’s room key. This card will also need to be used to sign in and out, and access the elevator and stairwell lobby on the first floor and the main lobby after business hours. The student identification card is used to identify the student as a representative of the Governor's School on other occasions. Students should have their ID cards with  37 them at all times.

The identification card is non-transferable and to be used only by its owner. Improper or fraudulent use of the identification card, which includes borrowing or lending, is an infraction of the discipline code. H.

Visitor Sign-In Requirements All visitors must report to the Center Lobby desk upon their arrival to campus. The receptionist and/or security guard will welcome the visitor, inquire as to his/her business, and review the requirements to determine if the visitor needs a Raptor ID. If the guest is 16 or older, he or she will be processed through the Raptor system, which will require a government issued identification card. Once the check is completed, the visitor will be given a visitor’s ID to place on his or her shirt or jacket. The following individuals must be processed through the Raptor system: ? Parents of students or prospective students who are visiting on a day that is not deemed a special event; ? Anyone coming to visit a faculty or staff member; ? Contractors who have come to bid on work or perform work; ? Prospective students; ? Prospective employees. The following are examples of individuals who do not need to be cleared through Raptor: ? Visiting parents who are not moving beyond the Center Lobby; ? Official delivery personnel (USPS, UPS, food delivery) who will not be moving past the Center Lobby or the dining hall loading dock; ? Local police officers; ? Campus visitors participating in special events (e.g. Move-In and Move-Out Days, Convocation, Graduation, Preview Days, Interview Day, Research Colloquium, Long Weekend pick up, Athletic Events, and the like). It will be the responsibility of the person coordinating the event to ensure that the Public Safety and Security staff have information about these programs and activities. For most special events, visitors will enter through the North Lobby and will restrict their activity to that area and the radius hallway. J. Property Loss Parents and guardians should examine their homeowner’s insurance coverage to determine if they cover the student's property while attending GSSM. GSSM is not responsible for and does not provide personal property insurance for students, nor is it responsible for any personal property loss or damage.  39 VII. LEAVING CAMPUS A. Signing Out and Campus Curfew Any time a student leaves campus (campus is defined as the property between Railroad Avenue, Coker Avenue, Emmary Street, and Jordan Avenue), the student will record his/her departure in the sign-out book or via the computer sign in/out process in the lobby of the residence hall. To properly sign out, a student will legibly record the following information: full name, time of departure, expected time of return, exact destination(s), indicate whether you are riding in a vehicle or walking, name of driver (if applicable) and list all companion(s). Immediately upon return to campus, each student is to document their return by signing in. After campus curfew and before room check, students are permitted to be outside on the front lawn in the court year and/or on the soccer field. The designated area for the courtyard is up to the end of the academic wing and the end of the Student Activity Center, interior sides only.

Long Weekends (LWE) Long Weekends are designed to offer a much needed (required) break from academics and residence life at GSSM. Approximately once a month, a Long Weekend is scheduled. Long Weekends begin immediately after a student’s last class on Thursday and end the following Sunday. The Residence Hall at GSSM closes at 6 pm on the Thursday of LWE and reopens at 2 pm that following Sunday. All students must report back to the Residence Hall by 7:30 pm on Sunday. Weekend leave requests (see below) are not required for LWE since it is a required leave from campus and the Residence Hall will be closed. 40 D. Weekend Leave Request (WLR) Weekend leave requests are submitted electronically by parents or guardians using the online form on the GSSM website under current students, then parents. Weekend leave requests are then reviewed and approved by GSSM staff. Parents who have difficulty accessing the electronic weekend leave request should call the RLC office at 843-383-3901, ext. 3931 or the RLC cell phone at 843-858-1603. The RLC will advise you regarding your request. If it is necessary to confirm weekend travel plans with parent, a GSSM staff member will be in contact by phone or email. 1. Students who are signing out for the weekend must speak to the RLC on Duty before leaving. They are expected stop by the RLC office or call the duty phone before signing out of the building. 2. After students leave campus, parents assume full responsibility. 3. It is assumed that students recognize the importance of weekend study time and will use the weekend privileges judiciously. 4. Appropriate sign-out procedures must be followed when leaving for the weekend. 5. If a student returns to campus prior to the date approved on the weekend leave, they must also notify the RLC on duty immediately and note that their weekend leave ends at that time. 6. All requests for weekend leave must be made prior to 5 pm on the Thursday before the designated weekend. 7. Parents should contact the Residence Life Coordinator on duty at the earliest convenience if a student needs to be late returning from a Weekend Leave Request, Long Weekend, etc. E. Off-Campus Regulations and Vehicle Riders Policy 1. GSSM does not regulate with whom a student may ride during weekends. Parents must communicate directly with the student their rules for riding in vehicles. a. Students visiting with family and friends on weekends will restrict travel to a 30-mile radius of Hartsville unless the student is on an approved weekend leave. b. Policies pertaining to Signing-out/Signing-in, Campus/Town Boundaries, Student Companions, and Vehicles on Campus as found in this handbook must be followed. c.

By enrolling students in the school, parents extend permission for them to travel in school vehicles or in private vehicles of faculty, staff, or other adults who participate in school programs. F. Student Trip/Event Behavior Student participation in any GSSM sponsored trip, event, or Interim program will be solely at the discretion of the sponsor or chaperone. 41 Any inappropriate behavior will be addressed with the student, the parents, the Vice President for Student Development, and/or the Director of Campus Life. When considering students for participation in future trips, events, or Interim programs, past behavior will be considered. G. Leaving Campus with a Family Member Students must complete an Excused Absence Form (see someone in the Student Development wing for assistance) three days in advance if they plan to leave campus with a family member for an overnight trip or any length of time in which classes, scheduled events, or QUEST will be missed.

Activities A comprehensive student activities program is provided and is designed to complement the strong academic program at GSSM. Student activities will be prepared by the Director of Campus Life, the Student Activities Coordinator, Residence Life Coordinators, and Resident Assistants who organize a variety of social activities such as dances, picnics, etc., for the students of the school. Additionally, students may participate in school clubs, school publications, and various other activities. B. Student Council The GSSM Student Council is the principle voice for the student body to the school’s administration and faculty on matters of school policy. In a spirit of cooperation, loyalty, and school spirit, the Student Council stresses good citizenship, works to encourage worthwhile activities within the school, and strives to improve the quality of life for everyone in the school community. The Student Council represents, at all times and to the best of its ability, the ideas, wishes, and attitudes of the student body. More specifically, the Student Council serves as a bridge between the student body and the school’s administration, faculty, and staff by which student concerns can be heard and addressed. The school’s administration depends heavily on the Student Council for student input on policy matters directly affecting the student body. The Student Council consists of 14 members (8 seniors and 6 juniors) who are elected annually by their respective classes. The duties and responsibilities of the Student Council are as follows: 1. To act as a barometer of student opinion 2. To assist the school’s administration, faculty, and staff in gathering student opinion on new policies that directly affect the student body 3. To suggest to the school’s administration ideas for the betterment of the school 4. To promote the general social life in the school 5. To stimulate student interest in school activities 6. To assist the Director of Campus Life in the chartering and monitoring of clubs and organizations 7. To promote respect for the school and for private property 8. To organize and promote general and special elections 9. To interpret the Constitution and Bylaws as necessary C. Student Activity Board The Student Activity Board (SAB) is made up of two elected students representing each floor and is advised by the Student Activities Coordinator and one of the Residence Life Coordinators. The Board has regular meetings with the advisors to plan activities for the student body. The members are responsible for planning dances, campus-wide events, and large off-campus trips. Students are involved with all aspects from planning, preparation, and advertising to cleaning up for SAB events. 46 D. Clubs Club interest and registration is determined at the beginning of each school year and driven by student interest. While many clubs have remained active since their inception, participation fluctuates from year to year. Most clubs at GSSM are either academic or service oriented (e.g. National Honor Society, Math Team, Robotics Club, French Club, Beta Club, Interact, etc.). Clubs usually have local, regional, or national affiliations and GSSM students will often be representing the school either in service or competition at these various levels. To join a club, simply express interest and attend club meetings. You may also charter a new club by following the guidelines listed herein. To register a club students must: 1. Complete the club registration form obtained from the Director of Campus Life or his/her designee during the fall semester 2. Obtain a faculty or staff advisor who is willing to attend all meetings, activities, and functions  3. List all elected club officers (document when your leadership will be elected)  4. Club officer must attend leadership seminar sponsored by the Office of Campus Life 5. List all members and anticipated meeting dates and times 6. Estimate any activities and events in which the club might be sponsoring or participating To maintain active club standing, groups must: 1. Hold meetings at least once a month 2. Submit monthly reports to the Student Activities Coordinator and Student Council through the Interclub Council (ICC)   3. Participate in at least one service project per semester After the club registration has been submitted and the club request has been approved by the Student Activities Coordinator, the club will be reviewed by the ICC and the Director of Campus Life. Registered and active clubs are eligible to receive funds for activities and events. Money may be obtained by filling out a request with the ICC. The ICC committee and the Director of Campus Life will review the request and disburse club monies. Generally clubs are allotted $50 a year for activities. Local, Regional, and National memberships and registration fees can also be requested from the ICC for funding. E. Societies Societies are formed when groups of students with a shared interest in music, film, fun, sports, recreation, etc. seek to gather to share in their common interest (e.g. Society for the Easily Amused, Fancy Tuesdays, Rain Society, Football, Guitar, and Cheese Society, etc.). Being recognized as a Society is much easier and more flexible than registering as a club. For example, a Society is not required to have a faculty or staff advisor, elected officers, or hold regular meetings. However, Societies cannot request ICC monies or represent the school in any way. To create or register a society, complete the society registration form from the Director of Campus Life. After the society has been approved by the Director of Campus Life or his/her designee, the society can begin meeting. Societies may be registered at any time throughout the school year. 47 F. GSSM Ambassadors GSSM Ambassadors will represent the school in various ways such as speaking with parents and students during Orientation in May, attending and speaking at information sessions held throughout the state during the fall semester, helping the Admissions office as needed, hosting and serving as role models for prospective students, guiding campus tours for interested students and parents, and assisting with GSSM’s Preview Days in November and January. Ambassadors are nominated by their peers and carefully selected by a committee of staff and faculty in April. Ambassadors must exemplify the best qualities of GSSM, academically and interpersonally. Ambassadors exhibit the following characteristics: 1. Ability to communicate effectively with peers and adults 2. Ability to act as a positive representative of GSSM 3. A responsible attitude and behavior toward school and school-related activities 4. Effective time management skills 5. Ability to work well with others 6. Willingness to be helpful 7. Ability to think creatively and motivate others 8. Maintain academic integrity and ethics 9. Ability to appreciate individual differences and values 10. Ability to act as an effective role model 11.

Pride as a member of the GSSM student body Ambassadors are expected to attend meetings, actively volunteer, and maintain positive behaviors in and out of the classroom and on and off campus. G. Natural Helpers GSSM Natural Helpers are an informal “helping network.” Natural Helpers are the “front line” in assisting the Counseling and Residence Life staffs in meeting the physical, emotional, and psychological needs of our students. They serve as peer counselors and role models. They are nominated by their peers and carefully selected by a committee of staff and faculty. A Natural Helper is a facilitator in developing a relationship with his/her peers, helping to solve problems, and guiding new students in their adjustment to the GSSM environment. The mission of a Natural Helper is to instill a "sense of belonging" in the new students. Their goal is to assist new students in adjusting to the academic and social transition from their home high school to life at GSSM and to provide assistance to any student in need. Natural Helpers are selected each year by early March. 48 IX. ATHLETICS A. Athletics GSSM has sport programs sanctioned by the South Carolina High School League, which includes volleyball, basketball, cross-country, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track. Some sports have separate girls’ and boys’ teams, and others are co-ed depending upon the level of student interest. GSSM has produced multiple Region Champions/State Champions (Individual/Team). To participate on athletic teams, students must: 1. Be in good academic standing (students on Academic Probation may not participate) 2. Have an updated physical (valid from April 1 through the following year) on file at GSSM 3. Have health and accident coverage (a basic accident policy is available through the school) 4. Submit an official, original birth certificate. The school will make a copy and return the original to the student. Students may earn an athletic letter in any of the GSSM sports programs. At various times during the year, sports recognition programs may be held and letters and other honors awarded. Students with disciplinary records (extensive Level 1s, a Level 2, or Level 3) may not be permitted to participate in athletics. The Director of Athletics and coaches will determine if students will not be allowed to participate in athletics for disciplinary reasons. B. Physical Activity The Governor's School for Science and Mathematics believes strongly in our students’ need for physical activity. The purposes of the physical activity program are to: 1. Promote good health 2. Provide a means for releasing tension 3. Encourage lifetime fitness activities. There are systems in place to support and encourage the overall wellness of all GSSM students including the Wellness Reform and Intramurals. C. Seasons Fall Sports Winter Sports Spring Sports Boys and Girls Swimming Boys Basketball Boys and Girls Track Boys and Girls Cross Country Girls Basketball Girls Tennis Boys Tennis Boys and Girls Soccer Volleyball Golf D. Classes and Playoff Schedule Conflicts Athletes participating in the playoffs are permitted to leave class or miss class based upon the location and time of the scheduled event. The High School League, not GSSM, determines where and when the  49 playoffs will be played. The Director of Athletics and/or coaches will provide athletic rosters and request for dismissals. E. Overlapping Sports Participation Students participating in dual sports that have overlapping seasons will be reviewed by the Director of Athletics on an individual basis. No student should participate in overlapping sports if he/she has substandard academic reports even if he/she is not required to attend Pre-QUEST (e.g. a student has three C's and plays basketball and soccer that overlap. He/She may be removed from one or more sports based upon their academic standing). Students who commit to athletics should participate as much as possible, but academics are always first. F. Performance Enhancing Drugs Any student athlete who has tested positive or has been observed using illegal or performance enhancing drugs may be suspended or terminated from participating in athletics. He or she may also be subject to other disciplinary action based on the results of a full investigation. G. Gym Usage during the Academic Year 1. GSSM students are permitted to utilize the facility during the allotted time period. (Weight room usage requires at least two individuals in the room. No student shall use weight room without supervision.) 2. During the academic school year, GSSM Security will open and close the gym according to the following schedule: a. Monday – Thursday 6:00 am – 10:30 pm b. Friday 6:00 am – 12 midnight c. Saturday 8:00 am – 12 midnight d. Sunday 8:00 am – 10:30 pm 3. GSSM faculty and staff members are permitted to utilize the gym and weight room during the allotted time period. However, faculty and staff members are responsible for securing the building if used outside of published operating hours. GSSM faculty and staff members are expected to maintain a safe environment by cleaning up and replacing equipment to the proper areas. 4. Special events must be arranged, in advance, through the gym coordinator at 383-3901 ext. 2109. 5. Priority of Use: a. Academic class schedule b. Athletic team game/practice – GSSM c. GSSM intramurals/free play – All GSSM students d. GSSM assembly/Foundation assembly e. Athletic team game/practice – Coker and/or Community 50 H. Gym Usage During the Summer GSSM faculty and staff members are permitted to utilize the facility. (Students are not permitted to use the weight room during the summer.) GoSciTech (formally Summer Science Program) faculty and staff members are permitted to utilize the gym and weight room. GoSciTech students are permitted to utilize the gym with proper supervision, but they are not permitted to use the weight room. 51 X. SENIOR PRIVILEGES A. Optional QUEST Seniors with final grades in all semester and full year courses of at least an 85, may exempt QUEST during the Spring Semester, provided they have no serious disciplinary infractions. Should a senior with optional QUEST be placed on PreQUEST during the Spring semester, the optional QUEST privilege is forfeited for the remainder of the semester. This privilege is given to encourage students to learn to manage study time on their own in preparation for college. This privilege is not to suggest that seniors do not need to study, but to offer a more flexible study schedule set by the student. If necessary, this privilege may be modified or revoked at any time without advance notice; therefore, you should be careful to follow the guidelines and Student Handbook closely. 1. Seniors who do not QUEST may not have lights out extensions on the same evening. If you think you may need an extension, you must inform the Residence Life Coordinator at the beginning of QUEST that you are QUESTing. Otherwise, they will not know that you have participated in QUEST, and therefore, will not be able to grant you a lights out extension. 2. We need to continue to provide study environments for students; therefore, TV, videos, NINTENDO, XBOX, Wii, Playstation, and other games may not be played in the lounges during QUEST. 3. Seniors who are not QUESTing may use cell phones during QUEST but not in silent student areas as long as it does not interrupt other students’ study time. If this becomes a problem, this privilege will be taken away. 4. Seniors may not disrupt any other student’s QUEST, either through distraction or by noise. 5. No other rules or policies are superseded by this privilege (i.e., visitation). B. Room Painting Seniors will be allowed to personalize their room by painting a wall during the first month of school. Seniors who are interested in this privilege will be offered a palette of colors to choose from and GSSM will provide the paint, supplies, and instruction. The student will design and paint the wall. Since each wall painted will be repainted when you check out of your room, there will be a small, subsidized fee to cover the wall repainting and painting supplies. The following apply: 1. A student may only paint one wall. 2. Painting must begin and end during the designated time frame set by the Director of Campus Life. 3. All students must use only the paint supplied by GSSM. 4. All spills, drips, etc. must be cleaned up immediately. 5. All imagery and/or painting designs are subject to approval by the Director of Campus Life prior to receiving paint supplies. 52 C. QUESTing Outside During Daylight Savings Time, seniors are allowed to study in the patio area outside of the Cafeteria, and the semi-circle lawn in front of the school until 9:00 pm. (The study time may be adjusted by the Administration.) Seniors QUESTing outside must sign up on a special sign-up sheet for the patio and the front lawn so that all students are accounted for during QUEST. Outdoor QUESTers must follow all current noise guidelines for QUEST. Students studying in groups must not disturb other students who are studying around them. The following guidelines are in effect for outdoor QUESTing: 1. All relative rules that apply to indoor QUEST also apply to QUEST outdoors. 2. Students participating must sign up daily and indicate their study location as to front lawn or patio. 3. Students may not leave the assigned outside areas. Violators of outdoor QUEST rules will lose the privilege of outside study for one month. This penalty will carry over from Fall to Spring or Spring to Fall Daylight Savings Time periods. 4. Students or groups who are disrupting others will be asked to return to their room(s) and may be subject to the GSSM Discipline Code. 5. Seniors who are supposed to be QUESTing who are not engaged in study will be asked to go to their rooms. 6. Students may not move inside furniture to the outside (e.g. dining hall chairs, tables, lobby furnishing, etc.). 7. Students may not use CD, MP3 players, etc. without headphones during outdoor QUEST. 53 XI. DINING SERVICES A. Meal Schedule Students will be provided breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week in the GSSM dining Hall. GSSM dining services are contracted annually. The current provider is Aramark. Hours for dining are as follows: Monday-Friday Saturday-Sunday Breakfast 7:30 am – 8:30 am Lunch 11:30 am – 1:00 pm 11:00 am – 2:00 pm (brunch) Dinner 5:00 pm – 6:30 pm 5:30 pm – 6:30 pm B. Dining Hall Guidelines There are guidelines for the dining hall to ensure that all students, faculty, and staff can have an enjoyable dining experience. All dining services staff have the right to reprimand anyone for not following the guidelines for the dining hall. All write-ups received in the dining hall for inappropriate actions will result in work detail in the dining hall. 1. Dispose of all personal trash, whether dining inside or on the patio. Return all chairs to their proper positions after use. 2. Everyone is expected to wait in line for meals. No cutting in line is allowed. Allow yourself plenty of time to get your meal and eat before your next class. 3. Throwing food, utensils, plates, bowls, cups, napkins, etc. is strictly prohibited. 4. No carry out meals or drinks are provided, although when necessary, students may take a piece of whole fruit or cookie. 5. Meals will be provided for students who are ill and excused from classes. An RLC or other staff member will get your meal for you and deliver it to your room. 6. Everyone is to take his/her trays and dishes to the dish window after each meal. 7. Anything deemed inappropriate by the dining hall staff or any GSSM faculty or staff member may result in a write-up. 8. The Dining Hall is not to be used during non-dining hours for study, socializing, or meetings, unless given prior permission by the dining services staff or the Director of Campus Life. 9. Guests are required to provide payment for meals unless given permission by the Dining Services Director. 54 XII. WELLNESS SERVICES A. Health Services Office The Health Services office is currently open (when school is in session) from 7:30 am – 11:00 pm Monday through Friday. Saturday and Sunday hours are 11:30 am – 11:00 pm. The Sunday schedule is adjusted on the Sundays after the Long Weekends and Breaks and on the Saturdays when we have major programs and activities to accommodate the needs of the students. The Health Services office is located on the first floor of the GSSM building in room A137 and is staffed by nurses contracted through our local hospital. The coordinator of these services can be contacted directly at 843-383-3901, ext. 3957 or by email at atkinson@gssm.k12.sc.us. B. Emergency Services Emergency medical services are provided by Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, 843-339-2100. The student and his/her parent or guardian are responsible for any medical or dental expenses not covered by personal health insurance. Please request an additional/duplicate insurance and/or prescription card for your child. If a student is treated and released from the hospital, the parent should contact the School Nurse, the Director of Campus Life, or the Residence Life Coordinator on Duty prior to bringing the student back to GSSM. C. Health Records Every student must have the Medical Examination/Self History Form on file in the Health Services office. The information provided on this form is vital to our staff so the best possible care can be given to our students. Please note that the Self History portion is on the front of the form and it must be reviewed by the student’s physician in addition to the physician filling out the back of the form and signing the same. The form is due no later than June 19. A parent or guardian is responsible for updating the nurse if there are any changes regarding medications or the physical, medical, or psychological conditions of your child. Please do not send your child back to school with new medications or conditions and expect them to relay this information. Also, if any information changes regarding your contact information, such as a phone number or address, please inform Health Services directly and immediately. Health Services files are confidential and kept separate from the main files; therefore, changes must be relayed directly to the School Nurse. Health Services is also responsible for maintaining the student’s Release of Information form kept at the hospital. Correct information is important in the event of an emergency. D. Insurance All GSSM students must have accident and health insurance. Parents/guardians must provide proof of health insurance. Those families who do not carry such a policy will be required to purchase a policy to cover their child for medical treatment while at GSSM. Parents and guardians should examine their health insurance coverage to determine if it covers their child’s health while attending GSSM. GSSM is neither responsible for, and does not provide health insurance for students, nor is it responsible for any health or medical costs. We encourage parents to make $100 accessible to their student at all times for unplanned doctor visits and prescriptions. (If the prescription card is separate from the medical insurance card, please make a copy of it as well, front and back, and write the student’s name on all copies.) Please make sure your child’s INSURANCE INFORMATION is ALWAYS up to date and CURRENT. A copy of your insurance card (front and back) must be on file in Health Services. 55 E. DHEC and GSSM Immunization Requirements 1. SC State Law requires: ? Any student transferring from one school to another must transfer the immunization records to the receiving school. Only the new DHEC 2740 form is acceptable in the public schools in South Carolina for any vaccines given after January 1, 2014. The previous DHEC form 1148 is acceptable if no new vaccines have been given after January 1, 2014. A copy can be obtained from your county Health Department, pediatrician’s office, or current school. Please be specific that you are asking for the DHEC immunization record required for public school admission. Doctor’s records and pink shot record cards are not acceptable documentation. Additional vaccines such as meningitis or HPV may be put on a separate sheet as they are recommended, but not required. ? Religious exemption from receiving immunizations is DHEC form 1126, available from your county health department. ? Students who do not have a current immunization record on file after 30 days from the first day of school will be dismissed until such time as the school receives the proper immunization record. 2. GSSM requires: ? All students in attendance must have a current Tetanus shot. (Current means within the last ten years; however, if it has been 5 years or more, please request the Tdap vaccine, which offers additional protection from Pertussis, also known as Whooping Cough.) ? Documentation from a health care professional of current PPD (Tb skin test) is required (within the last 12 months). ? Indication, ON THE IMMUNIZATION FORM, whether a student has had the Chicken Pox disease or the Chicken Pox Vaccine. Please have your health care provider write it on the form. DHEC requires a minimum of one dose of the Chicken Pox Vaccine or documentation of having had the disease, noted on the DHEC Immunization form. A second dose of the vaccine is recommended by the CDC and is required by most of the universities where students are assigned for the Summer Program for Research Interns (SPRI). ? GSSM highly recommends students receive the Meningitis vaccine prior to admission. Please explain to your health care professional that your child will be attending a residential school and living in a residence hall just like in a college setting. ? GSSM also highly recommends that our students receive the flu vaccine when it becomes available in the fall. It will be made available through Health Services at cost. Parents and students will be notified when the vaccine arrives. F. Medication Policy and Doctor Information GSSM requires notification of all medications (prescription and over-the-counter) needed by students. 1. All oral prescription medications will be retained by the nurse, kept in locked cabinets in Health Services, and given by a health care professional or designated trained staff member. 2. The only prescription medications designated as “self-administered” medications and allowed to be retained by the student are Insulin, topical creams/lotions, eye/ear drops, inhalers/nebulizers, and emergency Epi-pens. These medications still have to be reviewed by and registered with Health Services. 3. Each student must have on file in Health Services: 56 a. A Medication Policy signed by the student and the parent or guardian b. Permission for Administration of Prescription Medication forms signed by the prescribing physician and a parent or guardian for each prescription medication brought to GSSM c. Physician’s Over the Counter Medication Permission forms signed by the student’s health care provider and a parent or guardian 4. Limited over-the-counter (OTC) medications may be retained by the student after review by Health Services. Controlled OTCs include, but are not limited to: a. Robitussin DM (or generic equivalent with dextromethorphan) b. Cold/Sinus medication containing pseudoephedrine c. Any medication with Diphenhydramine/Benadryl d. Melatonin  Students are not allowed to retain these medications, but they can be retained and  administered through Health Services. 5. Students who purchase OTC medications must show them to Health Services for review. OTCs are to be taken in accordance with the medication label or package insert, unless prescribed otherwise in writing, by a health care practitioner. The parent or guardian shall indemnify and hold harmless GSSM and its employees and agents against any claim arising from a student’s self-monitoring or self-administration of medication. 6. A limited number of OTC medications will be available in the Health Services office and given in accordance with your child’s physician’s orders, per the Physician’s Over the Counter Medication Permission form. 7. Requests from parents/guardians for administration of experimental medications and herbal/alternative medicinal products at GSSM will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the School Nurse and the School Administrators. 8. As specified by GSSM policy: a. All prescription medications and controlled OTC medications will be locked in the Nurse’s office, except those designated as “self-administered.” The prescription and controlled OTC medications will be dispensed on a daily, or as needed basis – depending on the medication and each individual student’s needs. b. The School Nurse must be notified immediately via phone, email, or in writing by a student’s parent/legal guardian, of any new medications, changes in dosage, or eliminations/additions of a medication. This includes OTC medications. If a student purchases an OTC, he/she must show it to the nurse for review. A corresponding Prescription Permission Form completed by the prescribing physician must accompany any change in dosage or new medication as soon as possible after any adjustment in treatment. If a prescription is discontinued, Health Services should receive notification from the prescribing physician verifying this discontinuation. c. All new medications brought to GSSM must be given to the School Nurse for review. If the Nurse is unavailable, the medication must be given to the Residence Life Coordinator (RLC) on duty. d. All oral prescription medications must be turned in to Health Services on the day you return from the Long Weekend, the weekend home, or a school break. If a nurse is not available, the medication should be left with the RLC on duty. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. e. Parents will be notified if a student fails to comply with the medication policy and/or his/her medication regimen. Non-compliance could result in disciplinary action. 57 f. GSSM reserves the right to refuse to honor medication requests that are not consistent with professional standards (e.g. manufacturer’s guidelines, Physician’s Desk Reference) and/or are deemed unsafe for the school setting. If this occurs, GSSM’s School Nurse, School Administrators, the prescribing health care practitioner, and the student’s parent/guardian will discuss alternatives for meeting the student’s needs. 9. All prescription medications must be in a bottle labeled with the student’s name. 10. All OTC medications must be in the original container. We ask that the student’s name be written on the bottle with a Sharpie pen. 11. Please schedule any doctor appointments needed for your child, on the Friday of Long Weekend. If/when prescription refills are needed, the new medication can be sent with your student when he/she returns. If your pharmacy has a location in Hartsville, you can transfer the prescription to Hartsville if you choose. 12. Health insurance is required. Please contact your insurance company regarding physicians and your approved provider(s) in Hartsville. Upon request, your insurance provider will send an additional insurance card, as well as a prescription card, for you to give to your child. Physicians accepting new patients at this time: Morphis Pediatric Group Caring Hearts Pediatrics 843-332-5121 843-383-4426 Local pharmacies: Hartsville Drug – 843-332-6581 ($1 delivery, but payment information is required) CVS Pharmacy – 843-332-4191 Rite Aid – 843-383-0921 Walgreens – 843-332-4523 Wal-Mart Pharmacy – 843-332-8111 (familiar vendor, but crowded with long waits) G. Student Illness Students must see the School Nurse, a Residence Life Coordinator, or the Director of Campus Life prior to missing a class for illness or the absence will be recorded as unexcused. Students may not be excused after the fact. The procedure for reporting illness is as follows: 1. If a student is ill, he/she must go to the School Nurse. If the nurse is not in the office, the student is to call or see the Residence Life Coordinator on duty or the Director of Campus Life. 2. If a student is in class and becomes ill, the student should ask permission from the instructor to leave class to see the nurse but then must follow the procedures as listed above. 3. The nurse may determine the student needs to see a doctor and will make the appropriate appointment for the student after consulting with a parent/guardian. Transportation to and from a local physician will be provided. If no appointment is deemed necessary, it is the student’s responsibility to notify a parent of his/her illness. 4. Students are required to see the nurse after returning from medical appointments and/or the hospital. All prescriptions must also be turned in and logged. 58 H. Excused Absences The student must come to the Health Services if he/she is too sick to attend classes. The student will be assessed and the nurse will make a determination as to whether he/she may be excused. The faculty and staff will be contacted so they are aware the absence is excused. A student should not stay out of class without an excuse. An unexcused absence may result in the student not being allowed to make up missed assignments. A maximum of (3) excused absences will be permitted per semester. If additional absences are needed, permission will be made on a case-by-case basis. The student will not be excused for a class after the fact. In other words, he or she may not come down at 10:00 am and be excused for a 9:00 am class. No exceptions will be made to this policy. 1. A student who is excused from class must remain in his/her room for the remainder of the day and night. 2. A student may leave his/her room only to seek additional medical attention or to heat food in the lounge microware. 3. Meals will be brought to sick students. A nurse will also check on sick students who have been excused from classes. 4. A student may not have visitors in his/her room or visit another student’s room on a day he/she is excused from class(es) for illness. We also ask his/her roommate to limit visitors to support the roommate’s recovery. 5. A student may not participate in athletics or other school events on a day he/she misses class for illness. 6. A student who misses two or more class days in a week due to illness must have medical clearance (Nurse and/or Director of Campus Life) before participating in a student activity or athletic activity. Based on the situation, this may require a doctor’s release. 7. A student with a temperature >102º or with an illness that will take more than 2 days to recuperate will be sent home for the duration of the illness. A student must remain at home for 24 hours after his/her temperature has returned to normal without the use of medication. 8. A student who is hospitalized or taken to the emergency room due to an accident, illness or injury may not return to campus without the Nurse or Director of Campus Life’s approval. 9. A student who was excused for illness the previous day should see the School Nurse the next day before attending class. These guidelines are in place to allow the student to rest and get well. Additionally, we want to decrease exposure to other students. Students who do not follow these guidelines will be asked to meet with the Director of Campus Life. I. Counseling Services Enriched academic programming for high school students brings many opportunities, but not always without its challenges and stressors. GSSM is pleased to offer on-site counseling as a part of the support services of our school. Students are able to access the resources of a licensed mental health professional in a setting that is convenient and comfortable to them, while being completely confidential.  59 Students may seek assistance for a variety of issues including relationships, homesickness, transitioning to residential living, stress and/or time management, anxiety, grief, depression, etc. These services are free to all enrolled students. In the event that intensive care is required, a student may be referred to a local therapist. 60 XIII. COLLEGE COUNSELING AND GUIDANCE A. College Counseling and Guidance College counseling, advising, and guidance services are available to students during business hours while school is in session. Students may stop by as needed to discuss academic and career matters. These services are confidential and free. Additionally, this office is available as a resource to the parents of GSSM students. B. PSAT, SAT, ACT and AP Testing To assist students in their preparation for applying to college, the dates of PSAT, SAT, ACT and AP exams are published in the school calendar. All juniors are required to take the PSAT while attending GSSM and may opt to participate in any or all of the other tests. Where applicable, the student bears the responsibility for the cost. Students not enrolled in an AP course at GSSM and choose to take the AP exam will be responsible for the entire cost of the test, which is currently $91.00 each. All exams must be paid for before they are ordered. Students are expected to complete some level of independent work outside of class in order to be fully prepared to sit for AP exams. Information on how to prepare for AP exams is available from either the subject instructor and/or the Guidance Department. C. College Application Procedures 1.

No skin should show below the student’s hand when placed palm down on your chest and the first finger is touching the collarbone. No cleavage should ever show. Shoulder straps should be at least 1” wide. 3. Body Piercing No exposed body piercing jewelry is allowed with the exception of earrings. 4. Hats and Caps Hats and caps may be worn in buildings. D. Informal Dance Dress Code (Including dancers and attendees) 1. Shorts/ Skirts Shorts and skirts should reach the end of the fists when arms are held at the sides. 2. Shirts Spaghetti straps of all widths are allowed, though strapless or one-strap tops are not. 3. Midriff/Cleavage Midriff should not show with arms held at sides. No cleavage may show. 4. Shoes Shoes are not required within the perimeter of the dance. 65 E. Special Occasion Dress Code 1. Business, Formal Event Dress This is the dress code for special events such as convocation, colloquium, SCJAS, senior banquet, concerts, recitals, and plays. Additional occasions that require this type dress will be designated and announced by the Administration throughout the school year. Students are required to keep this type of attire at GSSM at all times. For males: dress slacks, dress shirt, tie, sports jacket, brown or black dress shoes and dress socks; for females: nice (business) dress, skirt or pants suits, dress skirt and blouse, and dress shoes. No clogs, Birkenstock style shoes, platform shoes over 1” high, hiking boots, or athletic shoes are allowed. This is considered “GSSM Dressy.” 2. Prom and Winter Formal Appropriate formal attire is acceptable for the Prom and Winter Formal Dance. If a student is unsure if his/her clothing is acceptable, he or she should ask the event sponsor for clarification before the event. 66 XV. APPROPRIATE USE POLICY (AUP) FOR GSSM TECHNOLOGY GSSM’s computer network supports research and education by providing access to useful shared resources and to facilitate collaborative work. Uses that support this purpose, and that facilitate school operations receive the highest priority. Other uses, which interfere with GSSM objectives, are prohibited. By definition, a network is a shared resource. GSSM’s network is shared by its students, teachers, and administration. Those who use the network accept the responsibility to use it appropriately. This Appropriate Use Policy describes those responsibilities and the rules that apply to users of the GSSM computer network. A. Ethical and Behavioral Standards Those who use the GSSM network are expected to follow the same standards of conduct and communication that would be expected in face-to-face encounters. These standards are described in the GSSM Student Handbook. Some responsibilities are unique to the environment created by computer networks and are addressed here: 1. Online Safety GSSM cares about the safety of students and is deeply concerned about the increasing incidents of assault on young people by those who locate or arrange meetings with their victims through Internet-based social networking services. These services can be dangerous when personal information, particularly information that can lead to the identification or location of a person, is published openly. GSSM strongly encourages students to secure their profiles so that they are not visible to strangers. 2. Online Harassment GSSM’s policies against harassment are in effect whenever and however students encounter each other, including online encounters. The use of Internet services within and beyond the control of the school to harass another student is a violation of GSSM rules and will be vigorously investigated and prosecuted. When harassment involving non-GSSM services is observed or reported, the school may engage law enforcement agencies and the courts to compel the service provider to disclose identifying information about the harassing party. 3. Online Identity/Login Credentials GSSM provides network users with credentials (username and password) for the purposes of accessing network resources. These credentials are intended to be used only by the person to whom they are assigned. Credentials assigned by GSSM must be kept secret and may not be divulged to anyone else. The person to whom network credentials are assigned is responsible for all activities that occur when those credentials are used. Further, it is a violation of GSSM rules for a person to impersonate someone else by either using their credentials, or any other means that might obfuscate identity. GSSM students will be provided credentials to access online databases while using the Coker College library. While these credentials are issued by Coker College, their use is governed by this AUP. Unless otherwise authorized in writing, login credentials expire upon graduation, dismissal, withdrawal, or other termination. 4. Intellectual Property As an educational institution that values the contribution of research to the quality of life and civilization, GSSM strongly supports the rights of owners of intellectual property. Many Internet services facilitate sharing and collection of digital content like music and movies in violation of the rights of their owners. Acquiring, possessing, or sharing digital content in violation of copyright is illegal and prohibited at GSSM. 67 5. Prohibited Access  Attempting to access protected information without authorization is a serious violation of GSSM rules, in addition to applicable governing laws. Users are prohibited from all activities that could reveal the existence or configuration of servers, databases, network services, or security features. Scanning to discover network resources is expressly prohibited. 6. Pornographic Material All persons who use the GSSM network are prohibited from viewing, accessing, or possessing pornographic material on GSSM-owned computers, or via the GSSM network. Attempts to circumvent, disable, or otherwise render content filter measures ineffective are a violation of GSSM rules. It is important to note that when students use networks off campus, the school is unable to regulate the content available to them. Particularly during summer research internships and while conducting assignment research at the Coker College library or any other collegiate library, GSSM students will access networks not equipped to prevent access to pornographic material. Colleges and universities are only required to enforce their own published access standards, which will vary between institutions. Families should discuss this issue and recognize that the school accepts no responsibility for material accessed at other schools, colleges, libraries, or other sites where internet access is provided. 7. Conservation of Shared Resources Network resources may be overwhelmed when used indiscriminately. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each person who uses the GSSM network to conserve resources where possible so that they are always available for others to share: a. Internet circuit capacity GSSM utilizes a commercial-grade connection circuit to provide Internet access to the campus. Priority for using this service is given to educational and campus operation purposes. Recreational use is allowed, but may never interfere with higher priority uses. GSSM will manage this resource by prioritizing Internet traffic, limiting or eliminating interfering services, and other means as necessary. b. Message and file storage GSSM servers provide spaces to store messages and files. They are intended to support educational and campus operations. Therefore, they should not be used to store media collections or for other recreational purposes. GSSM servers may never be used to store illegal content. c. Printers GSSM does not charge students for paper, ink, or toner expenses consumed when using GSSM-owned printers. The school expects that students will use these resources conservatively to minimize both expenses and impact on our environment. GSSM printers are intended to support educational activities only. B. Using Your Computer at GSSM GSSM encourages students to bring computers to school for use in their rooms, classrooms (when allowed by their teacher), and around campus. Attaching a personally-owned computer to the GSSM network indicates acceptance of this AUP and places specific responsibilities upon the owner: 1. Owner Responsibilities Computer owners are responsible for ensuring that their computers are virus-free prior to connecting to the network. Computer owners may be held responsible for damage created by computer viruses, or other activity originating from their computer. When it is determined that a computer is threatening the stability of the network or other computers, it will be removed from the network immediately. Owners are also responsible for maintaining their own computers. GSSM does not have staff available for computer repair. Computers should  68 be in good working condition when they arrive on campus. Owners should back up their important files often to prevent loss in the event of a computer failure. 2. Antivirus Software is Required Every computer that is connected to the GSSM computer network must have effective, up-todate antivirus software installed at all times. This protects the computer owner as well as others on the network. Computers found to have out-of-date or no antivirus software installed maybe removed from the network. 3. Dynamic Network Addressing The GSSM computer network automatically assigns IP addresses to each connected computer. This address must not be tampered with or changed. While assigned IP addresses are dynamic and subject to change without warning, in practice these numbers will rarely change throughout the school year. 4. Network Registration Computers are registered to their owners when they log into wifi and present a username and password, or when they attached to a network port in a are student’s room. Attempting to conceal the ownership of a computer is a violation of school rules. 5. Accessible Hours The computer network is available Monday through Thursday from 6:00 am until Midnight, and from 6:00 am Friday through Midnight on Sunday of each week. These hours may be modified in the event of an academic Saturday. 6. Prohibited Devices Certain network devices can interfere with network operation. Any kind of DSL/Cable router has this potential and is prohibited on the network. Wifi access points, hot stops, routers, and other devices that provide wifi network services to others reduce the number of channels available to the GSSM network, reducing performance in the area where they operate. Only wireless devices acting as clients of the school’s wifi network are allowed. 7. Prohibited Software Software that creates durable connections to Internet services, or that allow others on the Internet to access, share, or control computers on the GSSM network represent security risks and are therefore prohibited. Any software that scans networks or computers for vulnerabilities, any software that interferes with the GSSM network or devices attached to it, or any software that facilitates circumvention of any GSSM rule is prohibited. 8. Wireless Network Govienet is GSSM’s wireless network for students. The password for connecting to Govienet is distributed regularly. Once connected to Govienet, an additional username and password is required to gain access to the Internet. These credentials are requested infrequently. Using another student’s credentials is prohibited as is using other wireless networks not intended for student use. A guest network is available for visitor use, and instructions for connecting to it are posted in the main lobby. Internet access through the guest network is more restricted and slower than Govienet. 9. Microsoft Office As part of its site licensing agreement with Microsoft, students may download current, and some previous, versions of MS Office to their computers and portable devices. This privilege does not extend to family or friends and ends upon a student’s separation from the school. GSSM provides this service as a convenience to students and makes no guarantees regarding compatibility, fitness, or availability for any particular task. Students who download and install Microsoft products accept any and all license terms applicable to their use. 69 10. Compatibility GSSM makes no guarantee of compatibility between student-provided equipment and its networking equipment, services, software, etc. C. Privacy In order to protect the computer-using community and to enforce GSSM rules and policies, the school reserves the right to examine, restrict, or remove any material that is on or passes through its network. Such activities are not undertaken routinely or lightly. In addition, specific information about computer use is collected and preserved over time: 1. Internet locations visited This information is logged for each Internet user and device. 2. IP addresses assigned to each computer When an IP address is assigned, the hardware address of the computer, the IP address assigned, the date and time of the assignment and location of the computer requesting the address are recorded. 3. Log in/out information User name, network location, date and time are recorded when logging into or out of some network resources. There are privacy issues associated with using public GSSM web sites that are described at: http://www.scgssm.org/privacy-policy. D. AUP Violations Violations of the AUP may result in temporary or permanent loss of network use privileges. Depending on the nature of the violation, additional disciplinary actions may be taken. E. Amendments These policies may change from time to time as circumstances warrant. The most current version will always be posted online at http://www.scgssm.org/appropriate-use-policy. 70 XVI. IMPORTANT LAWS AND GSSM POLICIES A. Weapons Weapons are forbidden at GSSM. Applicable state law describes such weapons. Please note that GSSM will abide by all SC state and federal laws as they pertain to our school. Articles such as knives needed for cooking, hatchets needed for camping, etc., must remain under the control of faculty or staff. All equipment pertaining to weaponry (martial arts, paintball and fencing paraphernalia, bows/arrows, etc.) must be stored with the Director of Athletics. Relevant state law: South Carolina Code of Laws SECTION 16-23-430. Carrying weapons on school property. (1) It shall be unlawful for any person, except State, county or municipal law-enforcement officers or personnel authorized by school officials, to carry on his person, while on any elementary or secondary school property, a knife, with a blade over two inches long, a blackjack, a metal pipe or pole, firearms or any other type of weapon, device or object which may be used to inflict bodily injury or death. (2) A person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. Any weapon or object used in violation of this section may be confiscated by the law enforcement division making the arrest. B. Possession or Use of Tobacco GSSM does not allow the use of any tobacco products by any student while they are GSSM’s responsibility. Smoking, possession of, or the use of any tobacco products by any student is forbidden while on and off the GSSM campus or at any GSSM activity or event. This also includes electronic cigarettes, paraphernalia used to facilitate the use of tobacco (e.g. pipes, cigarette paper), vaporizers, and other devises associated with nicotine and vapping use. Violations are Level 2 offenses, as described in the Discipline Section of the Student Handbook. Relevant state law: South Carolina Code of Laws SECTION 16-17-500. Sale or purchase of tobacco products for minors; proof of age; location of vending machines; penalties; smoking cessation programs. (A) It is unlawful for an individual to sell, furnish, give, distribute, purchase for, or provide a tobacco product to a minor under the age of eighteen years. (E)(1) A minor under the age of eighteen years must not purchase, attempt to purchase, possess, or attempt to possess a tobacco product, or present or offer proof of age that is false or fraudulent for the purpose of purchasing or possessing a tobacco product. C. GSSM Drug and Alcohol Policy With the intent of providing a healthier life for the individual and a safer school environment, the following policy has been developed regarding drug and alcohol possession and use by GSSM students. In every case, policies developed by GSSM consider the health and welfare of the student of utmost importance. As a learning institution, GSSM always seeks to educate first. We believe that it is our mission and purpose to help students learn from every experience they have while in attendance with us. Positive outcomes are always sought, even in negative experiences. Through our professional staff, and as necessary, outside agencies, a student in violation of this policy may be required to enter into counseling to assist in maintaining a clearer understanding of the dangers of drug and alcohol and/or abuse and to help them design and implement a program for dealing with his  71 or her problem. The GSSM psychologist and staff will work with the student and his or her family to develop a plan that is most effective for meeting the student's immediate and long term needs. Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, illegal drugs, prescription medication not prescribed to the student, or paraphernalia is prohibited while enrolled at GSSM. GSSM will adhere to all applicable state and/or federal laws dealing with drug and alcohol possession and/or use. Law enforcement agencies will be notified in cases where it appears there have been violations of the law or when deemed appropriate for health or safety reasons. Any punishments levied by law enforcement agencies are separate from those given by GSSM. Relevant state law: South Carolina Code of Laws SECTION 20-7-8920. Purchase or possession of beer, ale, wine, malt or other fermented beverages. (A) It is unlawful for a person under the age of twenty-one to purchase or knowingly possess beer, ale, porter, wine, or other similar malt or fermented beverage. Possession is prima facie evidence that it was knowingly possessed. A person violating this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. SECTION 20-7-8925. Purchase or possession of alcoholic liquors. (A) It is unlawful for a person under the age of twenty-one to purchase or knowingly possess alcoholic liquors. Possession is prima facie evidence that it was knowingly possessed. It is also unlawful for a person to falsely represent his age for the purpose of procuring alcoholic liquors. In the event of reasonable suspicion that a student is under the influence or in possession of an illegal drug, alcohol, or prescription medication not prescribed to the student, the medical needs of the student will be evaluated immediately and the student may be transported to a medical facility at the discretion of the School. Alcohol and/or drug testing may be initiated, as appropriate and safe in light of a student's medical needs. Permission for medical personnel to conduct such testing, signed by the student and at least one of his or her custodial parents or guardians, must be on file before the student may be enrolled at GSSM. If testing is deemed necessary, it will be done in a private and confidential manner. Parents will be notified of the situation at the earliest practical opportunity. 1. Possession In the event a student is found in possession of an illegal drug, alcohol, a prescription medication not prescribed to the student, or related paraphernalia, the following measures will be taken: a. Parents will be notified to take the student home immediately. b. The student’s room and personal belongings will be searched. c. A Judicial Council will convene as soon as possible assess the situation and determine possible action(s). 2. Alcohol In the event of reasonable suspicion (see “Terms Defined”) that a student is under the influence of alcohol, a Breathalyzer test may be administered onsite by appropriately trained GSSM Staff as a preliminary assessment. Based on this assessment, the student may be transported to a certified testing laboratory for testing and evaluation. 3. Drugs In the event of reasonable suspicion that a student is under the influence of an illegal drug or a prescription drug not prescribed to the student, the student may be transported to a certified testing laboratory for testing and evaluation. The student also may be suspended immediately. 72 4. Testing a. Positive test results: If the certified laboratory test result is positive for drugs or alcohol, the student will be suspended immediately. Pending receipt of the drug test results, a student may be asked not to return to school. Circumstances under which the student may return to classes are outlined below in the portion of this policy entitled “Conditions for returning to GSSM following a suspension for substance abuse.” Additionally, ? Parents will be notified to take the student home immediately. ? The student’s room and personal belongings will be searched. ? A Judicial Council will convene promptly to assess the situation and possible actions. b. Refusal to submit to testing ? The refusal will be interpreted as a positive result. ? The student will be suspended immediately. ? The administration will contact the parent. ? The parent must pick up the student as soon as practical. c. Negative results ? The student may return to normal activities unless either medical or other disciplinary intervention is necessary. 5. Conditions for returning to GSSM following a suspension for substance abuse a. In rare instances with unusual extenuating circumstances, the Judicial Council may assess an extended suspension rather than convening an expulsion hearing. b. If a term of suspension is assessed by the Judicial Council, the suspension normally will be completed prior to the student’s return to school. c. The student and his or her parent(s) must agree to a regular program of monitoring to ensure cessation of use prior to GSSM considering the student’s return. The family must sign a release allowing the technician/assessor, the Psychologist, and/or the School Nurse to exchange information regarding the incident and all test results and recommendations. d. The student and family must reach agreement with the Psychologist regarding any necessary program of counseling to support the student’s efforts to return to health within a reasonable time following return. e. Failure to complete the recommendations from the assessment and provide a drug/alcohol test indicating cessation of use may result in an expulsion hearing. f. The family is expected to work in cooperation and in a timely fashion with the School Nurse and Psychologist in completing any prescribed program of counseling and/or the recommendations from all drug/alcohol assessments and subsequent follow-up. 6. Possible Sanctions a. 1 st Offense: Possession, use, or distribution of alcohol, any illegal drug, prescription drug not prescribed to the student, or related paraphernalia constitutes a Level 3 violation as outlined in the Student Handbook. ? The student will be suspended immediately. A Judicial Council will convene according to the Student Handbook to consider the matter further and an expulsion hearing should be anticipated. A request to withdraw from GSSM pending judicial  73 action may be considered by the Hearing Officer. A withdrawal pending disciplinary action will be noted on the student’s transcript. ? The distribution or intent to distribute alcohol, illegal drugs, drugs not prescribed to the student, or drug paraphernalia on GSSM grounds or at school sponsored events will result in a recommendation for immediate expulsion. ? Additional restrictions may be imposed by a club sponsor or coach regarding participation in extra-curricular activities or athletics. ? Students who violate GSSM’s Drug and Alcohol Policy may be denied the GSSM diploma, although the student will receive a state diploma if he/she has earned sufficient credits. b. 2 nd Offense: The student will be immediately suspended. If the student is found to have committed a second offense, he or she will be recommended for immediate expulsion. The expulsion will be reflected on the student’s transcript. 7. Terms Defined “Reasonable Suspicion” is based upon a belief that a student is using or has used alcohol or drugs in violation of this Policy drawn from specific objective and articulable facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in the light of experience. Reasonable suspicion may be based upon, but not limited to, a student exhibiting behaviors consistent with drug or alcohol use such as erratic behavior, slurred speech, odor of alcohol or drugs on breath, body, or clothing, staggering, vomiting, bloodshot eyes, association in a situation involving drugs or alcohol, or reports of drug or alcohol use provided by reliable and credible sources. Suspicion could result in an immediate Breathalyzer test or an alcohol/drug screening by a certified technician at the certified testing laboratory or both. “Use” means consumption of or being under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, and/or prescription medication not prescribed to the student while under the jurisdiction of GSSM during the period of student enrollment. Suspicion of use will result in: a. A drug/alcohol test at the GSSM designated testing site (The Medical Group, 206 Swift Creek Road). Parents of the student are responsible for the cost of any recommendations made beyond the initial alcohol/drug assessment. b. Refusal of drug/alcohol test will be considered the same as a positive drug/alcohol assessment. “Alcohol and Illegal Drugs” are defined to include all alcoholic liquor and beverages; all controlled substances under the Controlled Substance Act except when prescribed for the student by a licensed physician and properly registered with GSSM Health Services; cannabis under the Cannabis Control Act; any “look-alike” substance; inhalants, hallucinogens, and mood altering chemicals or substances. This also includes prescription medication not prescribed to the student. “Alcohol/Drug Test”: Test(s) administered for the purposes of determining the presence or absence of alcohol, illegal drugs, prescription medication not prescribed to the student, or their metabolites in a student’s bodily fluids, products, breath, or urine. “Drug/Alcohol Assessment”: A screening done by a physician or certified technician to determine the presence of alcohol or any other illegal substance in a person’s system. The assessment includes a recommendation made by a physician, certified technician, or  74 drug/alcohol counselor for action necessary to restore the individual to drug or alcohol-free state. “Possession”: Includes alcohol, illegal drugs, and/or prescription medication not prescribed to the student being found on a student’s person or stored in the following locations: clothing, backpack, room furnishings and other personal belongings, or automobile. The production of or attempted production of alcohol or illegal, hallucinogenic, or mood altering chemicals or substances is also considered possession. “Paraphernalia”: Includes empty alcohol bottles or cans, and drug articles including pipes, papers, or other materials used for drug use, storage, disguising use, or any materials considered to be intended for production, purification, diluting, or escalating the potency of any illegal substance. “Certified Testing Laboratory” is a medical test facility employing technicians trained and certified by the National Alcohol and Drug Center. Currently GSSM uses The Medical Group on 206 Swift Creek Road in Hartsville, which is a certified testing laboratory. 75 XVII. DISCIPLINE AND HONOR CODE VIOLATIONS Appropriate conduct, including respect for all persons and property within and beyond the school community, is required of all students at GSSM. All students are expected and required to accept responsibility for their actions. The guidelines established in this code pertain mainly to students while on campus, but objectionable behavior will always be considered grounds for disciplinary action, no matter where it occurs. GSSM discipline policies are intended to provide the basis for fairly and equitably requiring appropriate conduct by all students. Most pertain to the host of relatively minor issues that arise among students living away from home, often for the first time, and might be viewed as the means to insist on responsible behavior without nagging. However, the policies are also designed to cover more serious issues of misconduct, although these are much more uncommon. The Vice President for Student Development receives a discipline report periodically to assist in identifying students who have difficulty meeting the disciplinary standards of GSSM so that they can receive counseling. Parents also receive a discipline report for their student each grading period. The basic instrument of the discipline system is a written notification of misconduct, called a “write-up.” When a student receives a write-up, he/she will be notified in person at the time of the incident or via email. Offenses are divided into Levels 0, 1, 2, and 3 in order of relative severity. Sanctions for these offenses are similarly scaled. A. Disciplinary Offenses and Typical Sanctions 1. Level 0 Offenses (apply to 1st quarter Juniors only) Warnings will be issued for up to three violations. The fourth and subsequent violations will result in a Level I violation. Level 0 offenses include, but are not limited to, the following: a. Failing room inspection b. Late submission of a weekend leave request (first offense only) c. Violating the dress code d. Sign in/Sign out violation (for all students throughout the year) Level 0 write-ups are intended to serve as reminders for learning. Sanctions do not apply unless four or more are accumulated. 2.

Descriptions of Specific Sanctions 1. Guidelines for 8 pm In-Room Restriction An 8 pm restriction begins at 8 pm and lasts through 7:30 am the following morning. During this restriction, the student is expected to remain in his or her room and remain quiet. Specifically: ? Students must meet with the Residence Life Coordinator immediately prior to serving this sanction. ? The student may not leave his or her room. ? The student may not be in his or her suitemates’ room. ? The student may not have a guest or suitemates in his or her room. ? The student’s roommate may not have a guest(s) or his or her suitemates in his or her room. ? The student may not use the bathroom area for interactions/conversations with anyone. ? The student may not have room doors open. ? Emergency phone calls should be directed to the Residence Life Coordinator on duty so that the messages can be relayed. ? The student may not go to club meetings, lounges, lobby, etc. ? In case of an EMERGENCY, the student may contact the Residence Life Coordinator on duty directly. Please discuss what constitutes an emergency with the Residence Life Coordinator prior to the start of your restriction. ? The student is required to report any violations of the guidelines that occur while you are serving this restriction. ? Violations may result in repeating the sanction with additional nights as penalty, 48-hour in-room restriction, or immediate suspension to home. 2. Guidelines for 48-Hour In-Room Restriction This restriction begins at 8:00 pm on any night and ends at 8:00 pm 48 hours later. ? All guidelines for 8 pm restriction apply. ? The student will have 30 minutes for each meal. This time may be spent only in the cafeteria for meals. The student may not spend extra time socializing with other students. The student will be required to schedule these times with the Residence Life Coordinator on duty prior to the start of your restriction. ? The student may be required to do several hours work detail during the sanction period including Suite Rotation. ? If there problems or questions during the restriction, the student will have to either talk with/leave a note for the Residence Life Coordinator on duty during the 30-minute meal break OR send his or her roommate down with a message/note. ? Violations may result in immediate suspension to home. 3. Probation A student may be placed on disciplinary probation if he or she has the following violations during an academic year: ? One set of 6 Level 1 violations and a Level 2 violation. ? Two sets of 6 Level 1 violations. ? At the discretion of the Director of Campus Life after any Level 2. ? Two Level 2 violations. ? Any Level 3 violation. Students will remain on probation for the semester in which it was imposed, plus one additional semester, except in unusual circumstances. 80 a. Violation of Probation: A student is in violation of probation if he or she has one set of six Level 1’s, a Level 2, or a Level 3 infraction while on probation. The violation of probation may result in suspension or expulsion from GSSM. b. Possible Restrictions: Students on disciplinary probation may not be allowed to participate in certain school activities, athletic events, or trips based on the nature of the violation. These restrictions will be imposed by the appropriate administrator (e.g. participation in athletics events will be assessed by the Director of Athletics. School activities and Residence Life trips will be assessed by the Director of Campus Life, etc.). Any restrictions will be communicated to the student and the parents. A student on probation should exercise great personal responsibility and integrity during this time of learning, growth, and consequence. Probation is best interpreted as a time to learn from mistakes while abiding by all GSSM rules and expectations listed in the discipline section of the handbook. 4. Suspension Students may be suspended for Level 2 or Level 3 offenses by processes described in the Section on Investigation and Imposition of Sanctions. The number of days of suspension will depend on the details of the infraction, but will not exceed seven academic days. The parent/guardian of the student is responsible for the student’s transportation. The student will not be allowed to drive his/her car home. A class absence due to suspension will be unexcused. Suspended students must take the responsibility for missed academic work through self-guided, individual study. Teachers have no obligation to repeat lectures, class activities, or laboratory work. Academic penalties may be imposed by teachers and will vary depending on the nature of the course. Missed quizzes, labs, and graded class activities may be recorded as “zero’s” with the result a reduction of no more than one half of a full letter grade for the semester. Students are allowed to make up major tests and other significant assignments. Students must complete this work within one week after their return from suspension. Teachers may impose a penalty on this work not to exceed one full letter grade for the test or assignment. This policy for graded work seeks to balance the ultimate goal of student learning and its reflection as a course grade with the burden on teachers to prepare make-up assessments, and the lesson that personal behavior may affect one’s opportunities as well as other people. Teachers will not provide any remediation or extra help for missed lectures. Each student is required to attend counseling as assessed by the guidance office. Records of student suspensions are retained as described in the section on Records Retention. Suspensions may be appealed as outlined in the section on Investigation and Imposition of Sanctions. 5. Expulsion A student may be expelled for any Level 3 Infraction or for violation of disciplinary probation by processes described in the section on Investigation and Imposition of Sanctions. Expulsions may be appealed, as also described therein. The student’s records will be transferred expeditiously to the institution designated by the parents. Records of expulsions are retained as described in the section on Records Retention. Important Note: Disciplinary actions and sanctions that involve probation, suspension, or expulsion will be reported to colleges and universities as required by the Common Application and most institutions of higher education. 81 C. Investigation and Imposition of Sanctions 1. Level 0 and Level 1 Offenses Any member of the GSSM faculty or staff may investigate a situation and impose a Level 0 or Level 1 sanction, with the oversight of the Director of Campus Life for consistency and fairness. 2. Level 2 Offenses The Director of Campus Life will investigate all situations involving Level 2 offenses with the exception of academic dishonesty violations, which will be managed by the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Honor Code violations may be heard by an Honor Council as described below. Violations potentially resulting in suspension will be heard by a Judicial Council as described below. For other violations, the Director of Campus Life will impose sanctions. The Director of Campus Life will make the initial determination as to the appropriate Council to investigate the situation. 3. Level 3 Offenses The Director of Campus Life normally investigates Level 3 violations. The Vice President for Academic Affairs investigates Level 3 academic dishonestly violations. Findings are reported to the appropriate Council for hearings as described below. D. Honor Council The Honor Council shall be composed of two faculty members and four students. One faculty member will be appointed as the Chair of the Honor Council by the President of GSSM and will serve the entire year. One faculty member and one senior male, one senior female, one junior female, and one junior male student will be chosen to serve on each case. 1. Honor Council Members The Honor Council shall be composed of two faculty members and a group of twelve student Honor Council members to be selected as follows: a. Selection Process for Student Honor Council Members: ? The GSSM student body must nominate potential student Honor Council members. ? Nomination and selection of Senior Honor Council Members will take place beginning on the first Monday in May. Nominations will be open for one week. ? Nomination and selection of Junior Student Council Members will take place beginning on the third Monday in October. Nominations will be open for one week. ? Each GSSM student may nominate up to 3 individuals in each of these categories: Senior Male, Senior Female, Junior Male, Junior Female. ? Nomination forms will be distributed to all students and completed forms must be turned in to the RLC office. ? The Student Council Moderator and Secretary will supervise the tabulation of the nomination ballots. b. A slate of nominees, consisting of the 10 most frequently nominated students in each category, will be presented to the GSSM faculty who will select 12 students (3 from each category) to serve on the Honor Council. 2. Responsibilities and Process a. The Vice President for Academic Affairs or his/her designee will determine if a case qualifies for an Honor Council hearing based on the guidelines noted above. If it does qualify, the VP for Academic Affairs or his/her designee will provide the accused student  82 the option of an Honor Council or having the Vice President for Academic Affairs or his/her designee complete the investigation and handle the case directly. b. The Chair of the Honor Council will call all meetings of the Honor Council, randomly select the students and faculty to serve on each case, and report the Honor Council’s findings and recommendations for action to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. c. The Honor Council may only hear cases involving Level 2 violations of the discipline code involving acts of academic dishonesty. These cases will be instances of Honor Code violations in which students report students when no direct faculty or staff involvement has occurred. The faculty and staff will inform the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Director of Campus Life or his/her designee of any alleged violations reported by students. d. A write-up documenting the violation and the sanction will be entered into the GSSM discipline system. (NOTE: Requiring students to complete incident forms or encouraging students to report incidents does not constitute direct involvement.) e. If the student who reports an incident desires confidentiality, the VP for Academics or his/her designee will proceed with the investigation. In these situations, an Honor Council is not permitted. f. If a faculty or staff member witnesses, reports, or investigates an incident, he or she will report the case to the Vice President for Academic Affairs or his/her designee and then will apply sanctions based on information indicated earlier in this section. In the case of a second offense, the Vice President will need to be informed and the case will go to the Judicial Council. g. Should the need for an Honor Council arise, prior to the selection of junior members, the senior members will be asked to serve. h. Once membership in all categories has been completed, the faculty members serving on the Honor Council will randomly select one student from each category to serve. i. A member of the Honor Council may be removed for a potential conflict of interest (suitemate, witness, relative, etc.). The accused student may request the removal of an Honor Council member. Removal of a member of the Honor Council will be at the discretion of the Chair of the Honor Council, who will select a replacement from students in that category. j. The faculty Honor Council members have the right to disqualify and remove a student member of the Honor Council. Possible reasons for disqualification may be, but are not limited to, multiple Level 1 offenses, any Level 2 or Level 3 offense, or a Level 1 offense related to dishonesty. k. The President of GSSM may replace the Chair of the Honor Council for potential conflict of interest in a case. l. The Vice President for Academic Affairs or his/her designee will inform the faculty and staff immediately of the results of all academic dishonesty cases and all Honor Council and Judicial Council results. m. Each faculty member must give students a written policy statement during the first week of class for honor code matters related to course work. This statement may be amended in writing at a later date. n. The Vice President for Student Development will serve as the appeals officer for all Honor Council cases. 3. Outcomes of Academic Dishonesty, Cheating, and Plagiarism Honor Code violations are thankfully rare. The most commonly encountered violation involves academic dishonesty. When students are found in violation of the honor code by the teacher, the following actions will be given for a first offense: a. Letter sent home b. Write-up for appropriate violation (e.g. Level 2 for intentional dishonesty) c. Zero for the assignment in question d. Complete assignment again (optional; to be determined by individual instructors) 83 For instances where extensive evidence of prior intent is available (e.g. cheat sheet, etc.) or for second offenses, the matter is referred to the Judicial Council. D. Judicial Council The Judicial Council will hear all Level 3 violation cases of the GSSM discipline code and Level 2 cases when suspension is a possible sanction and the Honor Council is not involved. The composition, duties, and procedures of the Judicial Council will be as follows: 1. Judicial Council Members a. The Judicial Council will consist of two permanent members and one randomly selected member. The two permanent members are the Vice President for Student Development or his/her designee as Chair and a faculty/staff member who is appointed by the faculty and staff and approved by the President. The randomly selected member must be a residential teaching faculty member. The residence life staff and the school counselor, as well as the members of the most recently convened council, are exempt from serving. b. When the Director of Campus Life or his/her designee refers a case to the Judicial Council, the Chair will, in the presence of one other faculty/staff member, randomly select a residential teaching faculty member to serve. ? Selection of the residential teaching faculty member will be by random drawing from the pool of faculty members deemed eligible to serve. ? Drawing will continue until an eligible residential teaching faculty member is selected. c. After the completion of the investigation by the Director of Campus Life and selection of the residential teaching faculty member for the case, the Judicial Council will meet to review all documentation and other evidence in the case. At the discretion of the Chair, these materials may be distributed prior to the meeting to expedite the process. The Judicial Council will identify any witnesses who should be present at the hearing to clarify their previous statements or to provide additional information. 2. Responsibilities and Process a. The Judicial Council will convene as promptly as circumstances permit after it receives a case. The meeting(s) will continue in a timely manner until the case is resolved. b. The Chair of the Judicial Council will notify parent(s) of the student(s) about the alleged disciplinary infractions of their child and of the proceedings of the Judicial Council. c. The Judicial Council will hold an evidentiary hearing of all Level 3 cases. The Judicial Council will convene an evidentiary hearing for all Level 2 cases if the Director of Campus Life or his/her designee or the President of GSSM determines that suspension is a possible sanction. d. The Director of Campus Life or another person designated by the President or Vice President for Student Development carries out the initial investigation of the Level 2 or Level 3 incident. The Judicial Council may call witnesses to give testimony that has direct relevance to the case. e. An informal hearing will then be convened where the accused student will have the right to present his/her case before the Judicial Council. The accused student may request that witnesses with information relevant to the incident be present and make statements on behalf of the accused. Judicial Council members may question all witnesses and the accused student. No one else, including parents, may participate in the informal hearing. After dismissing all witnesses, the Judicial Council will deliberate in closed session to reach a decision. 84 f. The accused student has the right to be informed of his/her alleged disciplinary infraction and will generally be provided the identity of the person(s) alleging the infraction. However, the Judicial Council reserves the right not to disclose the identity of the person alleging the infraction after considering all the circumstances of a particular case, including the possibility of retaliation if the student’s identity is revealed. 3. Outcomes a. The Judicial Council shall reach its decision by majority vote. The deliberations of the Judicial Council, including individual votes of members, shall be confidential. The Chair will promulgate the decision of the Judicial Council, as well as any additional information about the case. b. The Judicial Council will render one of the following decisions: ? Not responsible for charges. ? Suspension/expulsion not warranted, but lesser sanctions imposed. Case may also be referred to the Director of Campus Life for sanctioning. ? Suspension; Judicial Council will determine dates and length of the suspension and any additional sanctions as deemed appropriate. ? Suspension with a recommendation for Expulsion; student will be referred to the School Hearing Officer to schedule an Expulsion Hearing. c. The decision of the Judicial Council is final. However, any suspension or expulsion decision is subject to the appeals process as outlined below. If requested by the accused student or his/her parent, copies of all written witness statements will be provided to them. These statements will be presented in a form that deletes the names and personal references to students other than the accused. d. Parents of a student who is suspended will be notified in writing and will be offered a conference within three days of the date of the suspension. e. The President of GSSM or his/her designee has the authority to immediately suspend a student during an investigation or pending the convening of the Judicial Council. This decision will be made if the President determines it is in the best interest of the student(s) or the school. The Judicial Council will not consider this action as a finding of guilt. The Judicial Council will reach an independent decision based on evidence presented in the case. If the Judicial Council determines that suspension is the appropriate sanction, the days of suspension already served by the student while awaiting the hearing will count as part of the sanction. If the Judicial Council determines that the suspension is not an appropriate sanction, the student will be allowed to make up all work without penalty, and the days missed will be recorded as excused absences. E. Expulsion Hearing 1. Hearing Officer If a Judicial Council recommends expulsion, the GSSM President will designate a Senior Administrator to serve as the Hearing Officer. The GSSM President has the authority to expel a student without judicial council approval. 2. The Hearing a. The Hearing Officer will inform the student’s parent/guardian of the basis of the recommendation of the Expulsion Hearing. He or she will notify the student’s parent/guardian in writing of the time and the place of the hearing. The hearing shall take place within 15 days of the written notification of the expulsion recommendation and a decision shall be rendered within 10 days of the hearing. 85 b. At the hearing, an administrator will present the facts of the case on behalf of the administration, including the testimony of any relevant witnesses, if appropriate. At the conclusion of the administration’s presentation, the student and/or his/her parent/guardian may present witnesses with relevant testimony. Within the discretion of the Hearing Officer, either party may appropriately question the witnesses of the other party. In addition, the administrator may also ask questions. The student may invite a faculty or staff member to be present for personal support. c. The student may be represented by counsel at the expulsion hearing. However, if a student is to be represented by an attorney, he must notify the Hearing Officer at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. Failure to notify the Hearing Officer that a student will be represented by counsel at an expulsion hearing may result in the postponement of the hearing. The Hearing Officer will inform the student and parent/guardian of the decision within 10 days after the hearing. An official letter of notification will follow the initial contact. F. Appeals 1. Appeal of Expulsion a. If a student or a parent/guardian wishes to appeal an expulsion decision made by the Hearing Officer, a hearing may be requested with the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of GSSM. Such a request must be made in writing to the attention of the President of GSSM within five days of receiving notice of the expulsion decision. The student may be represented by legal counsel during this appeal. During the appeal, terms of the original sanction will be enforced. b. An appeal to the Executive Committee of the Board will normally be limited to the established record, and no new testimony will be allowed, unless the Board desires to hear additional testimony. The Board may reverse or alter the decision of the Hearing Officer. If an expulsion is overturned, the student will be allowed to make up work without penalty and all reference to the expulsion will be removed from the student’s record. 2. Appeal of Suspension a. If a student or a parent/guardian wishes to appeal a suspension, the request must be made in writing to the GSSM President within five days of notification of the sanction. The GSSM President will designate a member of the Senior Administration to hear appeals of suspensions. The appeal will be conducted as an informal hearing. The administrator who investigated and/or imposed the suspension, parents, and student may be present. The parents, student, and administrator will be allowed to address the Hearing Officer. It is within the discretion of the Hearing Officer to permit others to attend, at the request of either party. b. Within 10 days of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall render a decision in writing as to his/her decision. c. The decision of the Hearing Officer will be final. During the appeal, the terms of the original sanction will be enforced. If the appeal is successful, the sanction will be overturned and, in case of suspensions, the student will be allowed to make up all work without penalty and all reference to the suspension will be removed from the student’s record. 3. Appeals Not Involving Suspension or Expulsion If a student wishes to appeal a sanction, he or she may appeal to the appropriate person as follows: a. Level 0 and Level 1 infractions may be appealed in writing to the person who assigned the sanction. Appeals must be made within 24 hours of notification of the sanction. If it is  86 decided the appeal should be upheld, the student’s record will be changed; i.e., the infraction will not count. If the appeal is denied, the sanction will be served on the date assigned, or, if the sanction has been postponed, a new date and time (the next day, if possible) will be set. The decision will be final. b. Level 2 infractions levied by a Residence Life Coordinator or any other faculty or staff member may be appealed to the Director of Campus Life (or the Vice President for Academic Affairs for academic matters) or his/her designee in writing within 24 hours of notification of the sanction. The decision will be final. Appeals of Level 2 infractions levied by the Director of Campus Life must be made to the Vice President for Student Development or his/her designee in writing within five days of notification of the sanction. Verbal statements of intent to appeal are not acceptable. G. Legal Charges Legal charges may also result from any offense noted above that is a criminal act. Any disciplinary action by GSSM may be in addition to any penalty imposed in the criminal courts. CLOSING STATEMENT As an institution dedicated to education, the South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics realizes the importance of growth and change. To accommodate new or different policies or regulations and in the interest of bettering the student's educational experience, the Governor's School reserves the right to alter this handbook throughout the year. In the event of an alteration of this document, students will be notified at once. 87 GSSM WALKING MAP GSSM Walmart
