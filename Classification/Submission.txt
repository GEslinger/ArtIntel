The Types of Iris data, size of the dataset for each type: vector<vector<string>>, converted to double for calculations
Normalization process: Arithmetic Average
Distance Algorithm used: Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev

For each data set:
			Sampling size  <number of elements used for training>: 40
			Setosa:   	5.0375	3.44	1.4625	0.2325	
			Versicolor:	6.01	2.78	4.3175	1.35	
			Virginica:	6.6225	2.96	5.6075	1.99	

Testing
Process the remaining elements of all three datasets using the three averages to classify the data that was not used in training.
Determine whether the iris is classified correctly
Number of correct classificiations: 29
Number of incorrect classificaiton: 1
